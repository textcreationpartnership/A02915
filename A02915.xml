            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:26859:4"/> werewith the laying downe of our lives, which if wee did not, wee ſhould readily and moſt worthily be condemned for traytors; hovv much more are wee bound to ſeeke the preſervation and delivrance of the ſoule and body of our lord the King ſeeing wee ſee him in ſuch great ſpirituall danger as wee do. And if anie ſhalbe offended at vs for ſo doeing, they therein love not the King: and if our lord the King ſhould be offended at vs his ſervants for ſo doeing, the King therein loves not himſelfe: and if all men, and the King ſhould for this be offended vvith vs (which God forbid) yet herein wee are ſure our God wilbe well pleaſed with vs, in that wee have with our beſt ſtrength and faithfullnes obeyed him, who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds and teacheth vs, to admoniſh all men every where to repent, and this is our ſure vvarrant, and our aſſured hope and comfort. Now as wee have, (according as wee hold our ſelves bound) thus farr confeſſed Chriſts name before men by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, ſo wee ſhall (the lord aſsiſting vs) be ready, as wee hold our ſelves bound to confeſſe Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men by vvord of mouth, not fearing (through Gods grace) them that kill the body and after that are not able to do anie more. In this duty to God and his people, wee muſt needs confeſſe wee have hitherto greatly fayled, but wee will novv be ready the lord ſtrengthning vs rather to be ſacrificed for the publiſhing, of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and for the ſervice of your faith, then to faile as vvee have done both in our dutyes to God and you. This vvee readily vovve to God and promiſſe to you and to vvill to do this good is preſent vvith vs,
<pb facs="tcp:26859:4"/> but vvee find no meanes in vs to performe this duty and ſervice, &amp; vvee ſee a lavv in our fleſh ſtrongly rebelling againſt the lavv of our mynds but our aſſured truſt &amp; confidence is, that Gods grace alone is ſufficient for vs to make vs every vvay able vnto theſe thinges, vnto the vvhich of our ſelves vvee are no vvay able, yet wee vvill ſay with the holy Appoſtle Paul, If God be on our ſide, vvho can prevaile againſt vs? &amp; vvho ſhall ſeperate vs from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation or anguiſh, or perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or famin or nakednes, or perill, or ſvvord? no the lord vvee truſt in theſe thinges vvill make vs conquerors: and though our outvvard man ſhould periſh, or ſuffer many afflictions, (vvhich vvee vvere moſt foliſh if vvee ſhould not vvait for) yet let the people of God looke vnto the truth vvee vvitnes, &amp; conſider vvith holy and vviſe harts vvhether vvee have not good vvarrant, yea direct comaundement to do that vvee do, though vve be vnfitt and vnvvorthy for ſuch a ſervice. Shall vvee heare the lord ſay, Come out of hir my people: and ſhall the Spirit of God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him, that heareth: ſay Come: and ſhall not vvee ſay Come? Shall the vvord of the lord comaund to Call vp Archars againſt Babell, and all that bend the bovv to beſeig it round about, and let none eſcape, &amp; to recompence hir the dubl, Ier. 50.29. Reuel. 18. And ſhall vvee ſpare our arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves though they be vveake? and ſhall the Spirit of God ſay, All yee that are myndfull of the lord kepe not ſilence Eſa. 62.16. And ſhall vve hold our peace becauſe vvee are not eloquent? No, no, vvee have too long neclected our duties herein, and novv
<pb facs="tcp:26859:5"/> through Gods grace vve dare no longer do ſo: and therefore do vvee thus cry vnto you the people of God, ſaying Babilon is fallen, ſhe is fallen, Come out of hir, Come out of hir, for if you ſtill partake with hir in hir ſinnes, you ſhal certenly be partakers of hir plagues: and therefore alſo vvee ſay. Let him that is a thirſt, Come: and let vvhoſoever vvill, take of the vvater of life freely: and vvee call vnto all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Archers that bend the bovv, to come to the ſeige againſt this great Citié: and vvee pray all that are myndfull of the lord not to kepe ſilence, nor to give the lord reſt, till he repaire, and vntill he ſet vp Ieruſalem the praiſe of the vvorld. And our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevvall praiers vnto the lord are, and ſhalbe that the lord vvill enlighten your vnderſtandings, and raiſe vp all the affections of your ſoules and ſpirits, that you may apply your ſelves vnto theſe thinges, ſo far as his vvord and ſpirit doth direct you, and that you may no longer be deceived and ſeduced by thoſe falſe Prophetts who propheſie peace vnto you, vvhen vvar and deſtruction is at the doore, vvhich the lord give both you and them to ſee, that you may all flie vnto the lord for your delivrance and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

            <p>That there hath bene a generall departing from the faith, and an vtter deſolation of all true Religion.</p>
            <p>That the Propheſie of the firſt Beaſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. 13. is fulfilled vnder the Romiſh ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall povver and Gouerment.</p>

Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of theſe muſt needes be the cauſe, or els mens hartes would abound with ſorrowe, and their eies would power out floodes of teares, and they would vtter with their tongues and penns, lamentations of great woe.</p>
            <p>Now if it can bee ſhewed by the word of truth, that deepe error of darknes doth poſſeſſe the two laſt, that is, thoſe which through ignorance thinke in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there is no ſuch cauſe of ſorrowe: and thoſe that through ignorance do thinke that the danger is already paſt: then the firſt that cannot mourne, muſt needes fall vnder the ſharpe cenſure of great hardnes off hart, and incenſible deadnes of all affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Wee in the humilitie off our ſoules confeſſe that this worke is too great for our abilities, but our ſtrength is off the Lord, who is able to make vs ſufficient for theſe thinges, iff wee by faith in Chriſt depend vpon him, the which our faith being ſo full off infidelitie, it muſt needes followe that our ſtrength is full of all weaknes, which would beate vs to the ground for vndertakeing this or anie ſuch worke off the Lord, but that the Word off God compells vs. which commaundes vs ſtrickly <hi>to shewe our ſelves faithfull in a little:</hi> Mat. 25.19-30. From which ground (by the grace off God:) wee have beene drawen to doe that little wee have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done, and vndertake (through the Lordes gracious aſſiſtance) now to doe that wee ſhall doe, beſeeching, and truſting off his mercie towardes vs herein, that all the praiſe may bee given onely
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:26859:7"/> to the glorie of his name.</p>
            <p>Firſt then to ſhewe vnto them their error that through ignorance doe not ſee there is great cauſe off lamentation and woe, we require them to turne their eares to the propheſie of that great Prophett <hi>Chriſt Jeſus. Mat.</hi> 24.4-28. and <hi>Luke</hi> 21.8-31, <hi>Where hee foretelleth that when men shall ſee the abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deſolation ſpoken of by Daniel the Prophete ſet in the Holy places, then shallbee great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch as was not from the begining off the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this time, nor shallbee. And except thoſe dayes should bee shortned, there should no Flesh be ſaved.</hi> Hath the like Propheſie ever bene heard off? Or can there bee anie deſolation like vnto this deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? Wherein no Fleſh ſhallbee ſaved; No, from the begining off the World there hath not bene the like, nor ſhallbee ſaith our Saviour Chriſt. Who can remaine ignorant off theſe daies and times and what ignorance is it, not to knowe that theſe are even the dayes and times here Propheſied off: Have not warrs and rumors of wars beene heard off? Hath not <hi>Nation</hi> riſen againſt <hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>Realme againſt Realme?</hi> Hath there not beene fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, and peſtilence, and earth-quakes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places? And have not manie beene offended and betrayed one an other, and hated one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And have not manie falſe Prophets ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen? Doth not our Saviour Chriſt ſay, theſe are the begininges of ſorrowe? Now all theſe thinges being come to paſſe, which are the begininges of ſorrow; it muſt needes bee that the dayes of the hight of ſorrowe are now come. And doe not men now ſee the abhomination of deſolation ſet vp in the high places? Is it not deepe error off igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance then for men not to ſee that there is now
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:26859:8"/> the greateſt cauſe of ſorrowe and lamentation that ever was. And next to ſhewe in fewe wordes the error of them that thinke the danger of the daies is paſt. Let them looke vpon the wordes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, when he ſpeaketh off the ſhorting of thoſe daies, he ſaith in <hi>Mat. Then if any shal ſay, Loe here is Chriſt, or loe there is Chriſt, beleeve it not.</hi> And in <hi>Luke. Take heed, bee not deceaved, for manie will come in my name, &amp;c.</hi> Is not this inſtant theſe daies? was there ever ſo manie ſaying, <hi>Loe here is Chriſt, loe there is Chriſt?</hi> And was there ever ſo many falſe profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Chriſt, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d falſe Prophets? ſhewing great ſignes and wonders, if it were poſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave he verie elect, who can then denie, but that theſe are deepeſt daies of danger, whereof Chriſt gives ſuch warninge to take heed. Therefore eaſilie may they heare ſee their error into whoſe harts that yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination hath once entred to thinke that theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers here propheſied of are paſt. Why then if the end of theſe ſorrowes be not paſt, and the beginings bee paſt, as is ſhewed, then muſt it needes bee confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the daies of greateſt tribulation are preſent. But who conſiders theſe thinges? Or who regardeth the words of this great Prophet? If men did conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and carefully behould theſe thinges, what hart could conceave ſorrowe enough, and what head could conteyne teares, or tongue have ſufficient words to expreſſe and vtter, the ſorrowes fittinge theſe daies. If <hi>Ieremiah</hi> complayned for want of teares, and could not bee ſatiſfied with ſorrowing, for the ſlayne of the daughter of <hi>Syon,</hi> that periſhed by the ſword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and famyne, (which was but bodily death) how much more cauſe have men now to ſorrowe, to ſee men poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with bitter waters killed with fire, and ſmoake and brunſtone, ſtung with ſcorpions, hurt with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.5. and 8.11. And caſt into the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26859:8"/> great winepreſſe of the wrath of God, <hi>rev.</hi> 19.20 which is the everlaſting deſtruction of ſoule a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bodie in Hel, to ſuffer al the plagues, torments, and judgments off wrath for ever. Was the famine of bread, and the ſword of <hi>Nabuchad-nezzar,</hi> and the ſeaventie yeres captivitie, a ful ſufficient cauſe, to make <hi>Ieremiahes eyes faile with teares, his bowels ſwell, his hart turne within him, &amp; his liver to bee powred vpon the earth:</hi> And are not al the woes vttered by the ſeaven Angels from the ſound of ſeaven trompets, whereof an Angel flieing through the midſt of Heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaid with a lowde voice, <hi>woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth, from the ſoundes remaining of the trumpets of the three an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which yet muſt blowe their trumpets:</hi> And have not theſe three laſt Angells blowen their trumpets? a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doth not the ſound thereof yet ſound in our eares? and are not al the woes thereof yet in the ſight of our eies? are not al theſe woes (which are woes of everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting death and deſtruction) ſufficient to breake mens harts al into peeces? What ſtony hardnes of hart poſſeſſeth men in theſe daies, that their harts do not melt for theſe woes.</p>
            <p>A maine a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d general reaſon of al this is, becauſe this propheſie is of ſpiritual deſolations, diſtructions and woes, and cannot bee vnderſtood but with ſpiritual harts, nor ſene but with ſpiritual eyes, and the harts and eies off men are naturall and carnall, and therefore theſe thinges cannot affect them. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p>Another ſpecial reaſon is, becauſe men do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how far theſe thinges concerne themſelves, but everie Nation, and everie people, and everie Man puts theſe daies farr from them, as no waie apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning to them. If wee therefore could prevaile (Oh that wee might prevaile) by al the feare and love off God to perſwade men: and by the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26859:9"/> pittie of the ſalvation of their owne ſoules move them, with deepeſt conſideration to conſider how nearely thoſe thinges concerne them, leaſt they bee vnder theſe woes, and bee not aware thereof, which men may eaſilie be by reaſon of the great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: that is in all men perticulerly in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge of the Propheſie of this booke off the <hi>Revelation:</hi> Which moſt men (though otherwiſe accompted mightie in the Scriptures) doe paſſe by, ſeldome or never touching them in their Teachings, or writinges, being taynted (wee doubt not) with their owne inſufficiencie therein, which if they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it were comendable (their acknowledgment wee meane, not their ignorance): But yet their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ourſe is much more comendable, then all theirs that have buſied themſelves, to bring furth ſo manie yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie expoſitions of that holie writt, wee ſay yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie expoſitions, becauſe they are for the moſt part but according to the vaine ymaginations and fancies of mens myndes, without the warrant of the word and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Wee confeſſe in humility to our owne ſhame, we are better able to reprove this, then to correct it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging vnfainedly, and growning daily vnder the burthen of our owne great ignorance and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the vnderſtandinge off the propheſie off that booke. All this may further provoake vs with you, and you with vs to take heed, leaſt we bee vnder anie part of this deſolation and woe, vnder which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is, and remaines, he muſt periſh, as by the grace of God, wee ſhall make evidently appeare from the Scriptures, therefore let al People, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Tongues take heed and beware.</p>
            <p>And firſt to proceed in this cauſe, wee will endeavor to prove by the witnes of the vndoubted word of truth that all Nations and Peoples vpon the earth, that have, or doe profeſſe Chriſt (for of them onely is this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26859:9"/> propheſie) have beene vnder this abhomination of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. The words of the propheſie thereoff by <hi>Daniel,</hi> makes is moſt plaine, where he ſaith. <hi>In the middeſt of the weeke hee shall cauſe the ſacrifice &amp; oblation to ceaſe, &amp; for the overſpreading of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination, hee shall make it deſolate. Daniel.</hi> 9.27. Agreable to this propheſie, is that Revel. 11. Where it is ſaid. <hi>That the two witneſſes off God</hi> (which are the ſpirit of truth, and the word of truth in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of thapoſtles <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.26.27. <hi>act</hi> 5.32) <hi>Which are two Olive trees, &amp; two candleſtickes ſtanding before the God of the Earth, haveing power to shutt heaven that it raine not, &amp; to turne the waters into blood, and ſinyt the earth with all manner of plagues as often as they will. Their Corpes shall lie in the ſtreets off the great Citie, ſpiritually called Sodome &amp; Egipt. Three daies &amp; an half, &amp; after three daies &amp; a half, the Spirit of life from God shall enter into them, &amp; they shal ſtand vp on their feet.</hi> And with theſe two propheſies agrees alſo the propheſie Revel 12.14. <hi>Of the woman flieing into the wildernes into hir place, where she is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for a time, &amp; times, &amp; half a time.</hi> Let vs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire theſe propheſies together. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and oblations ceaſe in the midſt of the weeke, which are three daies and a half. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: Revela. 11. The two witneſſes (the Word and Spirit off Truth) lye killed in the ſtreets, three daies and a half. And Reve. 12. The Woman (which is the Kingdome of Chriſt <hi>the heavenly Ieruſalem, the mother of al the faithful, Gal.</hi> 4.) fleies into the wildernes for a time, times and half a time, which may with good warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t according to theſe propheſies be expounded to a day, two daies, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a half. Thus then we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude. The true ſacrifices, and oblations of the people of God. The word and ſpirit. And the Heavenly Ieruſalem, the ſpowſe of Chriſt, Ceaſing, ſpeing dead in the ſtreetes, and being fleed into the wildernes, it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26859:10"/> muſt needes followe that there was an vtter deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion off all the holy thinges, and of all the meanes of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>For further confirmation of this, ſee the wordes of Thapoſtle 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. ſpeaking of the laſt day, where he ſaith: <hi>That day shal not come except there come a departing firſt.</hi> It were much weaknes in anie to thinke that this is not ſpoken of a general depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in that there were manie particuler departings in Thappoſtle times. But here he ſpeakes of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the truth, <hi>and an exalting of an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie the man of ſinne, to ſit in the Temple of God, as God, shewing himſelfe that he is God, whome the Lord shal conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, &amp; abolish with the brightnes of his cominge:</hi> Theſe wordes ſhewe to the vnderſtanding of the moſt ſimple, that there is an vtter departing, in that there muſt bee a comeing againe, for the aboliſhing of this wicked man. And here may bee diſcovered by the way, the damnable hereſie of thoſe men, which are twice dead, and plucked vp by the rootes, and thoſe are they which are fallen from grace, which were once dead, and have beene quickned by the word and Spirit of God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d are dead againe, which now hold a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſay that the man of ſinne ſitts and rules in the Church off Chriſt. In this place it is ſhewed that the ſpirit of the Lords mouth conſumes the man of ſinne, and the brightnes of Chriſts coming aboliſheth him. Now wee confeſſe, if there can bee a Church of Chriſt, where the ſpirit of the Lords mouth is not, and where his brightnes ſhineth not, in ſuch a church the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinn may ſit and rule as God, and theſe men are onely fitt ſubjects for ſuch a Kingdome: but let the children off God learne to knowe and profeſſe that in the Church of Chriſt, there is the ſpirit of the Lords moueth, and his ſhininge brightnes, which conſumes and vtterly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:26859:10"/> aboliſheth the man of ſinne, and therefore they cannot both cule in one houſe. Now for the bare words about which they contend, thus much wee ſay (not to them, but to ſuch as may bee in danger to be ſeduced by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) Theſe are the words. Thappoſtle (ſpeaking of the man of ſinne, who exalteth himſelfe againſt al that is called God, or that is worſhipped) ſaith thus. <hi>So that he doth ſitt as God in the Temple of God, shewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he is God.</hi> Now as it is ſaid, he ſits as God ſhewing himſelfe that he is God, even ſo doth he ſitt as in the Temple of God, ſhewing it to be the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, This expoſition is agreable to the ground of the ſcriptures, and according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, for the ſcriptures teach vs every where, and wee beleeve. that <hi>Chriſt is the head of his Church, And he walkes in the midſt of the ſeave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore we ſay vnto theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as our ſaviour Chriſt ſaid vnto Sathan, hence from vs. It is written 2. Cor. 9.15.16. What concord hath Chriſt with Belial.

            </p>
            <p>Which way now (in finding out the ſecond Beaſt) ſhal we bee able to looke beſides that great Hyrarchy of Arch-Biſhops, and Lord-Biſhops? are not you they that pretend (in meeknes and humilitie) the word and power of the Lambe, who ſaith: <hi>Learne of mee that I am meeke &amp; lowly, &amp;c.</hi> But exerciſe the power of the beaſt, and ſpeake like the dragon: have you not made and ſet vp the image of the Beaſt? is not your pompe and power like his? and hath there not beene much like crueltie vſed by that power? Doth not the blood of the dead crie? and have not the impriſoned groaned vnder that crueltie? and do not the ſilenced at home, and the baniſhed abroad dayly complaine? may not all theſe crie. <hi>How long Lord, how long, when wilt thou revenge?</hi> Are not your Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories, and all the power that belonges vnto them, with al the reſt of your Courts, Offices, and Officers are not theſe parts of the image? are they not like the Beaſt? wil you ſay they are like the lambe, or like his Apoſtles, it cannot bee that you ſhould ſay they are, the feare of the Almightie would aſtoniſh you. And if you cannot poſſibly prove that power, that Pompe, that crueltie, thoſe Canons and Courtes with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longings and belongers therevnto to bee like the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be Then let the terror of the Almightie poſſeſſe you, and make you afraide to vſe and poſſeſſe al thoſe thinges vnder the pretence of the power of the Lambe.

Wee have fought a good feight, &amp; have finished out courſe: &amp; we have kept the faith. Hencefurth is laid vp for vs the Crowne off righteouſnes:</hi> But if this bee your feight (as it hath bene the feight of divers of your predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors) to cauſe as manie as would not worſhip the y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the beaſt <hi>(your Hyrarchie)</hi> ſhould be killed: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to make al both ſmale and great rich a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pooer, bond and free, to receive a marke in their right hand, or in their forehead, and that no man may buy or ſell, ſave he that hath the marke of the beaſt, or the number off his name, if this bee your feight it is evidently the feight of the ſecond Beaſt, and not the feight of Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul. And there is no Crowne off righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes laid vp for ſuch a feight.</p>
            <p>And do you not al theſe thinges, when you force and compel men to ſubmit to your whole conformity which is the perfect image of the beaſt? Not to ſpeake of your ſurplice, and Croſſe, and Churchings, and Burials, and Coopes, and Chauntings, and Organs in your Cathedrales, and how manie mo ſuch abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations wee cannot recken vp, neither need wee ſeeing ſo many writings are ful off them: but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhal looke vpon them, with an eie of leſſe then halfe vprightnes ſhal eaſily ſee them to come out off
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:26859:15"/> the bowels of the beaſt, and to bee the deformed image of his vgly ſhape.</p>
            <p>To let al theſe paſſe, (the leaſt whereof ſhalbe called to account in the day of the Lord) wee come to your Common Booke, not medling with everie perticuler of it, but with the moſt general. By what power do you make praiers, and bind men to them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the order of them in time and place? Whereoff two, you appoint to be read everie evening without alteration, ſome praiers to bee ſaid after the Curate bee paid his due, ſome on the North ſide the Table, ſome in one place, ſome in another: Will you ſee a ſpeciall ground of theſe four abhominations, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing your Preiſts what to pray, when to pray, and where to pray, and what to put on when they pray: Becauſe you made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o manie Preiſts, and have ſo manie yet among you, as niether knowe what to pray, where, nor when to pray, nor what to put on when they pray: in ſo much as if you did not allowe them a ſume of made praiers, they had beene, and yet would bee, altogether without praiers, and this doth the miſterie of iniquitie with the deceivea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of vnrighteouſnes, hide from the ſimple, and from the great and wiſe, by your made order of praiers: For take your Common booke from them, and then would the impudent bee aſhamed of ſuch a miniſtery. Oh that ten of the beſt and cheifeſt off a thouſand of thoſe your Preiſts might bee debarred from you booke, and bee ſet in a Congregation off verie partial herers of their ſide, to ſhewe their beſt abilities for the Office of the miniſtery. Baals Preiſts were not more diſcovered (1. King. 18.) Then they would bee, for the fault was in their God in that hee had no care to heare: But your Preiſts fault would be found in themſelves in that they would have no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26859:15"/> one word to ſpeake to Gods glory, nor to edification. How can you but knowe this as well as you knowe your right hand from your left? How will you aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere this when you come before the righteous iudg: ſhal you be able to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his preſence? the Lord give you harts to repent, otherwiſe how ſhal you thinke to eſcape the feirce wrath of the Lord. Did the Lord bring evil vpon the houſe of Ieroboam, <hi>&amp; ſwept it away, as a man ſweeps away doung til al bee gone,</hi> and did: <hi>The doggs eate him of Ieroboams houſe that died in the Citie, &amp; the foules of the aite eate him that died in the feild.</hi> Becauſe hee ſet vp Calves to worſhip, and make Preiſts of the meaneſt of the people, which were not of the ſonnes of Levi. 1. King. 14.10.11. and 12.31. And do you thinke to eſcape with leſſe iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſet vp the image of the Beaſt; and ſuch a blind Preiſthood to ſupport it? For you knowe that it is blind ignorance that ſupports the miſterie of iniquitie: And therefore ſhall the Lord by the brightnes of his coming aboliſh it. What ſhall wee ſay of your bare-headed and bare-footed white ſheet pennance, wherevnto (to mocke the Almightie) is ioyned a written repentance.</p>
            <p>Thus do you device mens praiers, and device mens repentances, and they muſt pray, and repent as you by your power appoint them. Have you power alſo to appoint the Lord to accept theſe praiers and repentances? Or do you not care whether the Lord accept them or no, ſo that you bee ſubmitted vnto therein, then do you ſeeke your owne Worſhip and not the Lords. Iudg your ſelves, and let all iudg. betwixt the moſt Holy Lambe, and the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Beaſt, and confeſſe and teſtifie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe thinges bee of the Lambe, or off the y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Beaſt.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:26859:16"/>
            <p>The like off theſe thinges are without our numbring, and there would bee no end made iff wee ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe them. But wee wil drawe to an end, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they that ſee theſe, wil ſee al.</p>
            <p>Yet let vs ſpeake ſome thinge of your excomunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the power whereof are caſt out thoſe that moſt ſeeke to ſerve God in ſinceritie, and if the moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fal vnder it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey may bee remitted (ſubmitting to the power) by paying large fees, eſpecially iff they bee rich, and ſimple or meane off degree. And whoſoever withſtands the power off this, fortie days, then vpon a writt off ſignification hee is to bee caſt into priſon, without bale, or maynpriſe. Is this learned off the Lambe or off anie off his Apoſtles? Wee read that Thappoſtles ſuffered ſuch violences and tiranies, but the word off God teacheth not the Diſciples off Chriſt anie ſuch adminiſtrations, and this is not the meekenes off the Lambe, but the ymage off the cruel power off the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>The power off this excomunication is off another eſpecial vſe off profit, in that by the power thereof are brought in al duties, Tithes and Court fees. What horrible prophanation off the holy ordinance of Chriſt is this, to make it an inſtruement to compell men to bring in exacted fees and due<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, tithes and duties. Wee confeſſe our Lord the King may give you what his pleaſure is, but it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that al thoſe goodly Pallaces and poſſeſſions with al the previleges and prerogatives belonging to them, were preſerved for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Kings State and dignity, and they were much more be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the King and his poſteritie / to ſupport them in their due pompe and Royalty, then to ſupport the pride and pompe of ſuch as pretend to be miniſters of the Goſpel. Thapoſtle Paule was better worthy off duble mainteynance then you, and al the Preiſts in al your Provinces and dioces, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet he labored with his hands, although he had the care of mo and more worthy churces the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are now vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, that would willingly have adminiſtred vnto him, but he would make the Goſpel free. Oh that we might live to ſee al them that preach the goſpel (if they ſtand in need) to live off the goſpel, that is of the free liberalitie off the Saincts: thoſe Paſtors would not devoure the flock, but feed it. And wee pray that the Lord would put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hart of the King to take into his owne hands al thoſe poſſeſſions, and tithes, wherewith thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring ſhepherds (that deſtroy the flock) feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: That day ſhalbe the moſt happieſt day to the whole Land, that ever was ſince it was a Land, and that in theſe 4. thinges. Firſt it would overthrowe that high pride and crueltie off the image of the beaſt and miſterie of iniquitie. Secondly it would make a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26859:17"/> way for the advancement of the Kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt in the ſincere and humble profeſſion thereof. Thirdly it would in-ruch the Crowne and fill the Kings coffers vpheaped, with ſuch a yerely revenewe as no peace nor war ſhould ever be able to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> half emptie, and all this may be done by a holy, good, juſt and lawful meanes. Fourthly it would in-ritch the whole land above meaſure, and that in diſburde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the land, of al thoſe Courts with al the ſuites, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſervices, that belonge vnto them, the taxations, fees and penalties whereof are without number. And the King would ſtand no need of taxes and ſubſidies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we would not wiſh the Kings people to with drawe the ſhewing off their loyale love to our Lord and King in thoſe things.</p>
            <p>Oh what a ful and ready conſent would there bee in the kings people to theſe things, how profitable would it be vnto them: the Lord perſwade his hart to it, ſeing it would be for Gods glory, his owne benefit, and the ſo great good of his whole land: and it would be the greateſt and cheifeſt benifit of all to them, to whome it may ſeeme the greateſt loſſe: for they ſhould be diſburdened of thoſe things, which although they he pleaſant for a ſeaſon, yet they wilbe moſt bitter in the day of account, which wil come let them be ſure, and it would make them live moderately of that they have, and vſe good and honeſt endeavors to ſupport themſelves, and there would be true comfort in ſuch gaine. Laſtly to make it appeare plainly enough, that this Hyrarchie of Arch Biſhops and Lord Biſhops is the image of the Beaſt, let al behold the names off blaſphemie which it bears, and they are theſe, ſo farr as wee knowe the number of them.</p>

Let them ſhed blood vntil they have enough: and let the ſervants of God reioyce in the ſaieing of the Angel of the waters. Revel. 16.5.6. <hi>Lord thou art iuſt, which art, &amp; which waſt, &amp; which shal bee becauſe thou haiſt judged theſe things, for they shedd the blood of the Saincts &amp; Prophets, And therefore haiſt thou given them blood to drincke, for they are worthy.</hi> This hath the Lord fulfilled vpon all thoſe that are dead, and have not repented of this abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and this wil the Lord fulfill vpon al that are alive, if they repent not. Is it not ſufficient to diſpoyle a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d rob Chriſt of al his power, but you wil alſo take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the rules of honor due vnto his name?

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26859:18"/> ſhould get you names of ſuch hidden blaſphemy, that ſimple men cannot vnderſtand without an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:) let vs ſpeake with fearefulnes off that name, which you might al tremble to heare off: and that is Lords ſpiritual. The verie artribute of the God of al ſpirits, for he onely is the Lord ſpiritual and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Lord. And give vs leave to ſhewe you how you are hedged in, that al ſubtile ſophiſtry ſhal not helpe you out. Beare you not this title by reaſon off your ſpiritual power and aucthoritie? and do you not by this your ſpiritual power and aucthoritie make ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Canons and decrees: and are not al your Courts ſpiritual Courts? and do you not require ſpiritual o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in al theſe things? is not your title a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d power a differing title and power from al other Lords? ſee how the ſtile doth hedg you in, which goes thus. <hi>All the Lords Spiritual, &amp; Temporal.</hi> So that you cannot ſay, you are ſpiritual Lords, beca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uſe of your profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for you wil not deny but the temporall Lords are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Lords in profeſſion as wel as you: Therefore muſt it needs bee that you are ſpiritual Lords becauſe off your ſpiritual power, and ſpiritual power is over the ſpirits off men: ſo then as Temporal Lords have power over mens bodies, ſo muſt ſpiritual lords have power over mens ſpirits, but there is onely one ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Lord, which is the Father of ſpirits: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoever taketh this title and this power vpon themſelves, they take vpon them the name, title, and power of God: and this is the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinne that ſits as God, ſheweing himſelfe to bee God, which herein the ſecond Beaſt doth according to, or in the image of the firſt.</p>
            <p>Do you thinke that God hath forgotten to bee iuſt? and are his judgments gone for ever? Can you ſee and condemne in your words and writings, the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation off the man of ſinne in the Romiſh profeſſion:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26859:18"/> and can you not ſee and condemne it in your owne? to ſuch ſaith thapoſtle Paul Rom. 2.3. <hi>O thou man that conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that do ſuch thinges, &amp; doſt the ſame, thinkeſt thou that thou shalt eſcape the Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for that duble degree of <hi>Reverend-fatherhood</hi> which you take to your ſelves, ſome of you being moſt <hi>Reverend,</hi> and ſome <hi>Right Reverend Fathers,</hi> how might wee find out vnder what condition you beare this name: It is plaine that you beare not that name becauſe you have begotten all that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Chriſt, for moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly you are their <hi>Reverend</hi> Fathers in God, before they ever heard your voices: then muſt it needs bee in you a name by inſpiration, ſeeing it is not by operation or worke. So are you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with a <hi>Reverend</hi> Fatherhood vpon the inſtant time of your entrance before you have wrought anie worke amonge that people. When you ſhall meet Chriſt in his coming, what will you anſwere him for the breach of his ſtrait commaundement herein, where he ſaith. <hi>Cal no man your Father vpon the earth, for there is but one, your Father which is in Heaven:</hi> Are you not exalted above your brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this name? then you are they of whome Chriſt ſpeakes of in this place, and whome he wil bring follow. Mat. 23.9.10.11. For thus takeing vpon you the name of God, and exalting your ſelves above the brethren. And iff you have not ſold your ſelves to worke wickednes (which God forbid) and if you thinke it robbery to make your ſelves equall with God, let your harts tremble, and your hands ſhake to ſubſcribe to ſuch names of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy: and let your eares tingle when you heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vttered and red in your preſence: and obſerve but what magnificency is vpon you when you ſit vpon your high places, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d heare your ſelves thus intituled, and remember that hee ſitts over you that will tread you vnder foote, for thus robbing him of his honor

            <p>Now for the next name of blaſphemy (that is within our capaſitie to ſpeake of) it is the title of <hi>Lords Grace,</hi> and this is your houſhold title, we meane it is a title that may not bee omitted in al ordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: doth not this attribute belong onely to the lord off grace? a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wil you have this prerogative with him: Now although this title be vſed (in what ſence wee knowe not) in the ſtiles off ſome civill Magiſtrates, where with wee meddle not, yet wee knowe all your titles off degree, you beare by a ſpiritual prerogative, and therein conſiſts the miſterie of iniquitie, and there fore are al your names of honor a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d prerogative (where by you challeng ſuperioritie) names of blaſphemy, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d directly againſt the expreſſe comaundment of Chriſt, who by his comaundment (that were worthy to bee obeyed) charged his Diſciples, that they ſhould in no wiſe ſeeke ſuperioritie in his Kingdome, neither in name nor power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lords of the Gentiles beare rule one over an other, &amp; are called gracious Lords, or beare names off honor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it shall not be ſo among you, he that wilbee greateſt shalbe leaſt in my Kingdome,</hi> that is he that wilbe exalted in name or power by being a Diſciple of my Kingdome, he ſhalbe the leaſt. Luk. 22.25.26.</p>
            <p>But the words of our Saviour Chriſt are not at al regarded herein, the man of ſinne will have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome where there ſhalbe mightie power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity one over anothers conſcience, appointing and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And this propheſie is

Luk. 16.31. And now al that do agree with vs in iudgment concerning the firſt Beaſt, that it is plainly to bee ſeene in that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh profeſſion, and that it is vnpoſſible that the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinne ſhould bee exalted in a higher meaſure of exaltation, wee cal you al fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore all you whome this may moſt

            <p>And if you wil yet iuſtifie your ſelves in theſe things and make ſhewe of your ſelves to bee the ſervants off the Lambe, and not the ſervants of the Beaſt, then ſtand furth and defend your Kingdome and cauſe, with the ſpiritual ſword of the Lambe, which is the word of God, and convince your gain-ſaiers, and ſtop their mouthes therewith, and ſo ſhal you approve your ſelves Biſhops in deed. And if you can prove by Gods word, that wee ought to ſay prayers, as you comaund vs, wee wil both ſing and ſay, as you bid vs: and if you can prove your names of blaſphemy, and titles of degree, your Pomp: and al your cruell ſpiritual pouwer, good, by that warrant, we wil yeild it you al, and not diminiſh you of the leaſt tittle there of. What need you feare to bring it to trial? You have learning enough, you have partakers enowe, iff you had but half a good cauſe: which battle if you will feight, we ſay vnto you as Michaiah ſaid vnto Ahab, when he would go vp to Ramoth Gilead: Take it in hand go vp and proſper: But wee wil tel you alſo with the ſame Prophet, that if you ſtand in this cauſe <hi>The Lord hath determyned evil againſt you.</hi> 2.

Shall wee need to be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with our lord the King in this cauſe of his poore people which concernes the condemnation of all their ſoules? what need wee, ſeeing our lord the King knowes, that <hi>a King that iudgeth the cauſe of the poore rightly, his throne ſhalbe eſtabliſhed for ever.</hi> Pro. 20.14. Then let our lord the King here the cauſe of the poore: and the rather in that the Kings moſt noble Predeceſſor, hath before iuſtly adiudged the ſame cauſe, and freed his people ſo far of the bondage wherein they were. King Henry the 8. that Prince of great renowne, freed his people from the bondage of the firſt Beaſt, eſpecially in

               <p>Let heaven and earth iudg, and let our lord the K. iudg, &amp; let all the Kings people iudg, whether this was not the depth of all darknes, when men might not knowe what God ſpeake vnto them, nor knowe in their publique worſhip what they ſpeake vnto God. Let our lord the K. iudg whether ever there was ſuch ſpirituall cruelty vpon the earth, when the poore people of God for whome Chriſt died, were debarred from the preſence of God, in their publique worſhip, &amp; might neither heare god, nor ſpeake to God, with their owne outward cares &amp; tongues, but as the Miniſters of the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinne appointed and in aſtraing tongue, as they taught them. Wee knowe our lord the K. doth ſee that heere the abomination of deſolation was ſet vp in the high places: as alſo that the Corpes of the two witneſſes of God propheſed of Reuel. 11.8. (which are the word and ſpirit of God) lay dead in the ſtreets of that great Citie, there being no true vſe at all of them, and the people being deprived of the life of them, for the word was a dead letter vnto them, and the ſpirit a dead ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The Kings predeceſſor of famous renowme, thus freed his people from that bondage of the firſt Beaſt: but there is riſen vp a ſecond Beaſt, which exerciſeth the power of the firſt Beaſt, and now our lord he Kings people cry vnto the King with the ſighes and groanes of their ſpirits (and

And now let the King heare with an eare of compaſſion, and ſee with an eie of pittie, the cruell ſpirituall bondage that his poore people are kept vnder by the ſecond Beaſt in theſe perticulers.</p>
               <p>The Kings people have the word in their owne language and may pray in their owne tongue: But they muſt not vnderſtand the word, but as the Lord Biſhops will have it vnderſtood, and they muſt not pray nor adminiſter in the holy things but as they appoint. Now let the King with a godly wiſe hart conſider in what woefull Spirituall bondage, Gods people, and the Kings, are kept by this Hyrarchy. Now plainely would our lord the King ſee the cruell Spirituall tyrany hereof, if the King would make it but his owne cauſe. Would not the King thinke it a muſt cruell tyranny, if the King ſhould be by force compelled to vnderſtand and beleeve the ſcriptures as the Hyrarchy of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me would have him? And to worſhip God and adminiſter in the holy thinges as that Hyrarchy would appoint? And if the King would not ſo do, that then that Hyrarchy ſhould have power to put the King in priſon, and if that would not ſerve the turne, to procure or cauſe the Kings life to be taken from him, or at leaſt to baniſh the King from his Kingdome, &amp; nation would not our lord the K. thinke this great tyrany &amp; cruell bondage? Wee knowe the King would: for which cauſe the K. and his predeceſſors have caſt of this bondage.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:26859:33"/> Then let the King ſee that the Kings people are vnder this ſame bondage: for if they will not vnderſtand the ſcriptures, and worſhip God, as the Hyrarchy of Arch.

               <p>And will it pleaſe the King to veiwe the cauſe of his people, (being true and faithfull ſubiects) yet further: what doth it profitt the Kings people to have the word of God to heare, and read it, ſeeing they are debarred of the ſpirit of God to vnderſtand it, but according to private interpretation, by the the lord B. as though they had the ſpirit and could not err. Oh that our lord the King that is a man of excellent wiſedome, would but be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his wiſedome to behold, how that herin (wherein the whole power of the Beaſt conſiſts) this Hyrarchy of Arch-Bs. &amp; lord Bs. doth nothing differ, from the firſt Beaſt: for the firſt Beaſt kepes both the word and ſpirit from the people: and they kepe the ſpirit of God in bondage, &amp; then is the word of God of no effect, debarring the people of God thereof, tying them to their ſpirits in the vnderſtanding of the ſcriptures which none may <hi>try whether they be of God or no,</hi> but muſt beleeve and obey, or els go to priſon, and if they will not yeild either he hanged or baniſhed.</p>

Next let vs ſhew the K. that if there be ſuch a ſin comitted, as the Bs. do iugd to be a ſin, according to their rule, (which let the K. give his ſervants leave to ſuppoſe to be adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery &amp; that it proceeds or comes to this degree that it muſt be told vnto the Church, which wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be the whole congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, moe, or leſſe: The lord Bs. by their ſpirit of vnderſtanding, ſay, <hi>tell the Church:</hi> That is to be vnderſtood, tell the Ordinary, which is either the Biſhops cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cellor, or the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons Officiall, they are they, that have power to bind in earth, &amp; it ſhalbe bound in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; their fees being, paid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they have power to looſe on earth, &amp; it ſhalbe looſed in heaven.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:26859:36"/> Furthermore let our lord the King knowe that whereas the Holy ghoſt teſtifieth Act. 14.23. ſaieing that <hi>they had ordeyned Elders by Election in every Church, and praied and faſted:</hi> this wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, was the whole Congregations faſting and praying, and Election; and that the Church hath power to appoint ſome to ordeyne or lay on hands, if there be no Elders as they did Act. 13.2.3. but all this (ſay the Lord B. by the ſpirit of our vnderſtandings) doth belong vnto vs, and the Patron: and the people have nothinge to do, but muſt be content to have ſuch a Paſtor, as wee appoint, though they never heard him, knewe him, nor ſaw him: and although the congregation after, ward ſhould like neuer ſo well of him; yet the Lord Biſhops they have power to take him away from them, &amp; to deprive him, and ſilence him, &amp; puniſh them if they heare him, although he be never ſo well approved amongſt them. Thus muſt the Kings peoples be compelled to vnderſtand the ſcriptures, for the advancement of their power of Ordination, and deprivation. And whereas wee the Kings ſervants vnderſtand, according to the beſt vnderſtanding that God hath given vs that Th-appoſtle Paul, giving a rule of direction for the people of God, how to worſhip God, when they come together 1. Cor. 14.26.33.

Thus do we hold the diſciples of Chriſt, ought to come together, to worſhip God and edifie one another, in the libertie of the ſpirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the gifts and graces that are given to

The lord Bs. vtterly deny the ſubſtance of all this vnderſtanding, and their ſpirit of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding directs, that when the Congregation, is come together, the Preiſt, or Curate, that is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed by them, onely muſt performe the worſhip, and muſt beginne their worſhip with their booke, ſtrictly tying them to ſuch ſentences: and then to that which is written after: then a Confeſſion: then an abſolution, with virſickles and anſweres, and Pſalmes, and leſſons, and Te Deum, and the Latany. 3. daies a weeke, and at other times, when the Ordinary ſhal comaund.</p>

               <p>And wee beſeech our lord the King (that is a man of wiſedome) to give righteous iudgment herein, whether the Lord Bs. do not challenge onely to themſelves all power to vnderſtand the ſcriptures and not to eer, when they will by force and violence of impriſoment, baniſhment, or death Compell the Kings people to yeild obedience to their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding onely: for if the Kings people muſt not beleeve, that they onely have the power of the ſpirit, and cannot eer, how comes it that the Kings peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt be compelled onely to obey them in all their vnderſtandings and practices? Except the Kings people muſt obey them though they do err. And if our lord the King will not altogether turne his eare from the deepe complaints, of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, then let the King heare his ſervants in this point, which is ſo hatefull to the King, and is of all eſtates (that have anie vnderſtanding in the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of godlines) ſo much deteſted; yea the Lord B. themſelves do in words profeſſe great deteſtation

Oh that our lord the King &amp; all his people, would ſee that the Hyrarchy of Arch-Bs. and Lord Bs. do no leſſe, although in word they deny it, yet in deeds they practice and hold the ſame thinge, that they cannot err. And this can never be denyed, neither ſhall they ever be able to open their mouth to deny it, if they might but be brought ta anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were: for ſhall they ever be able to anniſwere it, that they ſhould expound the ſcriptures, &amp; make ſpirituall lawes Canons, and decrees, &amp; comaund abſolute obedience: and in divers of their Canons, decreeing excommunication <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> but that they ſhalbe forced to ſhew by their deeds that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err: &amp; men muſt obey them vpon that ground, becauſe they cannot err, or els vpon this ground, that they muſt be obeyed although they do err: for they muſt be obeyed: vpon which laſt ground, thauſends do obey them. But wee beſeech our lord the King that it may be lawfull without offence vnto the King to try the Hyrarchy vpon the firſt ground, which is, that as the Hyrarchy of Rome ſay in words, they cannot err: that ſo in their deeds this Hyrarchy do abſolutely profeſſe they cannot err. Wee with our beſt ability make it plaine to our lord the King and to every eie and eare thus.</p>
               <p>The Hyrarchie of Rome, expounds the ſcriptures: makes lawes, Canons, and decrees, and binds all mens conſciences to obey, forceing them therevnto

And wee beſeech our lord the K. to ſee that the Hyrarchy of Arch-Bs. and Lord Bs. do all the ſame thinges; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſcriptures, make lawes, Canons, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, &amp; bindes all mens conſciences to the obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce thereof, forceing the Ks. true &amp; obedient ſubiects therevnto, by excomunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, impriſoment, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (the K. in mercy &amp; juſtice reſtraning them of blood) &amp; none may examine the power &amp; aucthority of anie of their decrees by the ſcriptures, but all muſt be received for holy, &amp; good. Doth not the K. in the wiſedome of his hart ſee, &amp; may not all the K. people ſee, that this Hyrarchy of Arch-Bs. and lord Bs. in all their deeds, do ſhewe, they challeng to have the ſame power not to err, which the Hyrarchy of Rome do ſay in words they have? &amp; thus do they abſolutely in deeds profeſſe they cannot err, which the Hyrarchy of Rome profeſſe in words, and herein the Hy: of Arch-Bs. &amp; lord Bs. are the more deceipt full deceiveablenes of vnrighteouſnes.</p>
               <p>And now wee beſeech the Creator of harts to give our lord the King a new hart to conſider of all the exalted abomination of deſolation executed &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by this Hyrarchy of Arch Bs. and Lord Bs. and let our lord the K. know, that it concernes the King highly on to conſider of it, in that it is ſet vp, and ſupported, and all the cruelty thereof executed by the Ks. power, whereby they make our lord the K. gilty, of all the impriſoment, baniſhment &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, which by the Kings power, they impoſe vpon all the faithfull ſubiects of the King who with ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their abhominations But aboue all, let our the

Oh wee beſeech the King that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive poſſeſſion, and the goodly apparence of this power may nothinge ſway with our lord the King herein: but let the King ſet before his eies, the worthy recorded remembrance (by the ſpirit of God) of Cyrus King of Perſia, who <hi>brought furth, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of the houſe of the lord, which Nabuchadnezzer had taken out of Ieruſalem, &amp; had put them in the houſe of his God</hi> Ezra. 1.7.11. Not regarding the monuments of his predeceſſors great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt, nor the diſpoyling of his Gods of ſuch bewtifull ornaments: nor the departing with treaſure of ſo great value. All theſe reſpects could not hinder this King for reſtoring the veſſells of the houſe of the Lord. Let our lord the K. be no leſſe mynded to the houſe &amp; Church of God: but let our lord the King freely reſtore at once, to the Church and houſe of God the whole glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power of Chriſt the onely King thereof, and perticulerly that moſt bewtifull ornament of Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ordination of the Biſhops and deacons thereof, who ought to be elected &amp; ordeyned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of the holy ghoſt Act. 14.23. &amp; 6.3. and who ought to be qualified withall and every one of thoſe gifts and graces ſet downe vp Th-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle 1.

And will our lord the King change all theſe and manie mo lawes, ſtatutes, and ordinances, which Chriſt Ieſus the mediator and King of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath appointed and ordeyned in his Church? Will the King take this power to himſelf to Elect in ſuch manner, and ſuch men, as the King thinkes good? And give names, titles, and power ſuch as beſt pleaſeth the King?

Wee ſtill pray our lord the King that wee may be free from ſuſpect, for haveing anie thoughts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking evill againſt them of the Romiſh religion, in regard of their profeſſion, if they be true &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſubiects to the King for wee do freely profeſſe, that our lord the King hath no more power over their conſciences then over ours, and that is none at all: for our lord the King is but an earthly King, and he hath no aucthority as a King but in earthly cauſes, and if the Kings people be obedient &amp; true ſubiects, obeying all humane lawes made by the King, our lord the King can require no more: for mens religion to God, is betwixt God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the King ſhall not anſwere for it, neither may the King be iugd betwene God and man. Let them be heretikes, Turcks, Iewes, or what ſoever it apperteynes not to the earthly power to puniſh them in the leaſt meaſure. This is made evident to our lord the King by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. When Paul was brought before Gallio de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie of Achaia, and accuſed of the Iewes for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading men to worſhip God contrary to the law. Gallio ſaid vnto the Iewes, <hi>if it were a matter of wronge or an evill deed, o ye Iewes, I would according to right mainteyne you,</hi> &amp; he <hi>drave them from the iudgment ſeat</hi> Act. 18.12.17. ſhewing them that matters of wrong and evill deeds, which were betwixt man &amp; man apperteyned onely to the iudgment ſeat, and not queſtions of religion. The like is ſhewed by the Twne clerke of Epheſus in Act. 19.38.39. And further Paul being in like caſe accuſed of manie thinges Act. 24. in the 25. chap. he appeales to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars iudgment ſeat, where he ſaith <hi>he ought to be</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:26859:41"/> judged approveing and juſtifieing thereby, that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars power &amp; judgment ſeat was the holy Ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Now let our lord the K. (whoſe honor it is wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to judg in thinges that differ) judg, whether there be in theſe daies, anie other earthly power or anie other ſpirituall power, but the ſame that was in Chriſt and his Appoſtles times, in which times, all earthly power, was in the hands of earthly Kings and Princes, and them that were in aucthority vnder them, and Chriſt and his Appoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les diminiſhed not Kings and Princes of the leaſt tittle thereof. And all ſpirituall power was in the hands of Chriſt and his Appoſtles, that were in aucthority vnder him, of which ſpirituall power &amp; aucthority, Chriſt nor his Appoſtles would ſuffer no earthly K. to diminiſh them of the leaſt tittle thereof, but rather gave them their lives: if then our lord the K. do deſerue that earthly Kings and Princes, had the ſame power then that Kings
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:26859:41"/> and Princes have now, and that Kings &amp; Princes had no power then over mens religion, which was ſpirituall and belonged to Chriſt: men were then to give vnto God, that which was Gods: and vnto Ceſar, and ſo vnto all earthly Princes, onely that which apperteyned to them. Then let our lord the King judg by what warrant of Gods word the King can now, take to himſelf a ſpirituall power, and ſet vp an Hyrarchy of Arch Biſhop &amp; Lord B. and give aucthority to them to make lawes and Canons of Religion, and to give them power to compell men vnto the obedience there of; by ſuch ſeveer courſes as they have done. Let our lord the King conſider (and the Lord give the K. wiſedome therein) that if no King nor Prince could have ſet vp ſuch an Hyrarchy, with ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and titles then, but they had vtterly troden vnder foot all the dignity and power of Chriſt and his Appoſtles (for Chriſt, and his Appoſtles muſt have bene ſubiect therevnto) neither may anie King ſet vp ſuch an Hyrarchy now, becauſe it doth vtterly tread vnder foot, all the dignity and power of Chriſt and his Appoſtles, as well now, as it had done then: for wee have now Chriſt and his Appoſtles in all their power &amp; dignity as well as they had in thoſe dayes according to that ſaying of our Saviour Chriſt in the parable. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophetts.</hi>

               <p>And wee humble beſeech our lord the K. a little to ſuffer the fooliſhnes of his ſervants, although wee may ſeeme as fooles vnto the king herein. If there had bene ſuch a ſteaing Hyrarchy ſet vp in Chriſt and Th-appoſtles daies, would the Hyrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy have ſuffered vs (that are thouſands of the K. of great Brittans ſubiects) to have gone to Chriſt &amp; his Appoſtles to have aſked them, whether wee ſhould
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:26859:42"/> have obeyed them or no, in all their Canons and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances? And whether wee ſhould have given the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe titles of ſuperiority, and all that ruling power which they challeng over vs the Kings ſubiects? ſureby they will ſay, they would not have denyed vs that liberty to have gone, in ſo waighty a cauſe, and being ſo manie, to have aſked Counſell of Chriſt, and his Appoſtles, what wee ſhould have done: 20. thouſands being ignorant, and 10. thouſands being doubtfull whether anie ſuch power might be ſubmitted too or no; and thouſands being out of all doubt, that it might not be ſubmitted vnto; they will ſay they would not have denyed vs: but wee knowe what their Canons would have made of it, and wee may ſuſpect juſtly, that they would have enformed the King that it were very dangerous to ſuffer ſo manie to go vnto Chriſt, and his Appoſtles for counſell and that it were not fitt to ſuffer ſuch giddy heads to have that libertie, for makeing rents and diviſions: and that it were much more ſafety, for the King to ſuffer them, to make all who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le by their power, and to ſubdue ſuch buſie refracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirits. Let the King with fauour ſuffer his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, thus to ſpeake by the way, leaſt perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture anie ſuch thinges come in the way. And wee the Kings ſervants now takeing it for granted that the Arch Bs. and lord Bs. (that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſuch great holines) would not have deneyd vs to have gone to Ieſus Chriſt and his Appoſtles to be directed. And if Chriſt and his Appoſtles, had, (in the hearing of all our owne eares, being ſo ma witneſſes) comaunded vs abſolutely not to yeild the Arch-Bs. and lord Bs. anie ſuch power or names, could wee yeld it them? Although the Arch-Bs. and Lord Bs. ſhould (with 20. thouſands of witneſſes) affirme, that Chriſt and his Appoſtles
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:26859:42"/> ſpake otherwiſe, to their hearing. Would our lord the King thinke it equall, that wee ſhould be forced to beleeue their hearing, becauſe they are lord Bs. contrary to the hearing of our owne eares, &amp; being ſo manie witneſſes of one Nation and tongue, beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des hundreth thouſands of witneſſes of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; tongues? Wee knowe our lord the K. would thinke it no more equall (if the caſe were ſo) that wee ſhould be forced to beleeve the lord Bs. heari<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, then that they ſhould be forced to beleeve our hearing.</p>
               <p>Then iugd O King, for the caſe is all one and the ſame: for wee have Chriſt and his Appoſtles in their writings, and they do abſolutely ſpeake to our vnderſtandings, that in no wiſe there ought to be anie ſuch Hyrarchy of Arch Bs. and Lord Bs. in Chriſts Church. And the Lord Bs. ſay, that Chriſt and his Appoſtles, ſpeakes to their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, that there power and names are not <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſts words.</hi> Can our lord the King (that is accompted a moſt wiſe and iuſt Prince in his iudgment) iudg, that wee are all bound to caſt away our owne vnderſtandings of Chriſts ſpeaking, and are to be compelled to beleeve and vnderſtand Chriſt to ſpeake, as the lord Bs. vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Chriſts ſpeaking? Oh let our lord the King with compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, conſider, whether ever ſince the heavens and earth were created, there was a more vnequall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame cruelty then this, that the Kings people ſhould be compelled (in a cauſe that concernes the everlaſting condemnation of their ſoules &amp; bodyes to Hell) of force to ſubmitt their ſoules and bodies to the vnderſtanding of the Lord Bs. that are not able to direct themſelves from the waies of death, but are periſhed every man, that ever bare that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with thoſe names and power, if they repented not thereof, although they had no other ſinne: and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:26859:43"/> they alſo that do now beare that Office with thoſe titles &amp; power ſhall likewiſe all periſh to everlaſting deſtruction, if they do not repent thereof, and caſt it away: the ſpirit of the lord hath ſpoken it Reuel. 19.20. <hi>the Beaſt was taken, and with him that falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that wrought myracles before him, whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them that received the Beaſts marke, and them that worſhipped his jmage, theſe both were caſt aliue into a lake of fire, burning with brimſtone.</hi> And thus mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting to our lord the K. that Ieſus Chriſt is onely K. of Iſraell, that ſitts vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Davids throne, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely hath the power of the King of Iſrael, and none may partake with him in that kingdome and power, who had the Spirit without meaſure: and yet neither he, nor his Appoſtles that had the Spirit without error to deliuer the Counſels of God, did ever by example, practice, nor by rule comaund nor give power that anie ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by anie bodily puniſhment to obey their lawes and Ordinances, which were infalibly true holy, and good: How much leſſe ought our lord the King to comaund, or give a power to Arch-Bs. &amp; lord Bs. (men full of the ſpirit of error) to make lawes &amp; Canons with aucthority from the King to compell by impriſoment &amp; ſharpe perſecutions, the Kings true ſubiects, and people of God vnto the obediente thereof: who for their religion to God (although they be contrary mynded to the K. therein) ought not (ſeeing they deſerue not) to be puniſhed either with death or bonds: &amp; this is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed to the K. by the teſtimony of King Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa and noble Feſtus the governor, who adiuged Paul to have done nothing <hi>worthy of death or bonds,</hi> but that he might have bene looſed, if he had not appealed to Ceſar: &amp; yet Paul was contrary myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Ceſar &amp; to the jewes in his religion to God:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:26859:43"/> But they iudged him by the lawe of Nations: by the power of which law, the Kings of the nations are to rule &amp; judg, according to their owne ſeverall lawes, againſt which law, Paul had not tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for his cauſe was concerning the faith of Ieſus Chriſt which could not be judged by that law.</p>
               <p>And let our lord the King give his ſervants leave to comend this to the Kings beſt obſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is worthy to be obſerved: that, where ſoever in the new teſtament throughout, the profeſſors of the faith of Ieſus, were adiudged by earthly rulers &amp; Governors, for anie thinge that they did or held of conſcience, to God, &amp; of faith to Ieſus Chriſt, if earthly Rulers and Gouernors tooke the cauſe in hand by their power, the iudgment was alwaes wicked and abhominable. And if our lord the King will but begin his obſeruation at the fore-runner of Chriſt, Iohn Baptiſt, whome Herod put in priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and beheaded. And then let the King come to Ieſus Chriſt, whome they iudged and crucified, <hi>finding no evill he had done.</hi> And ſo if it pleaſe the K. to looke throughout the whole booke of the Act. there the King knowes how the diſciples of Chriſt, were <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, threatned, beaten, ſtoned: The made Saul hauock</hi> with his letters of Comiſſion, <hi>and entred into every houſe and drew out both men, &amp; wemen and put them in priſon.</hi> Then <hi>Herod ſtretched furth his hand and vexed certen of the Church, and Killed Iames the brother of Iohn with the ſword,</hi> and <hi>Caught Peter and put him in priſon.</hi> Then were Paul and Sylas taken at Philippi, by the Gouernors and people, and were <hi>ſore beaten &amp; caſt into priſon, and the Iailer comaunded to kepe them ſurey, being charged to preach Ordinances which were not lawfull for the Romans to receive nor obſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here may our lord the King ſee a true patterne, how the people of God are perſecuted, when the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:26859:44"/> Civill power doth iudg their cauſe of their faith, and profeſſion in their religion to God. Thus have worldly Gouernors delt with the Church of Chriſt, when the diſciples fell vnder their cenſure for their faith to God. And all theſe ſentences of death, bonds, and perſecutions the King can iugd to be vniuſt and vnlaw full, in that theſe Rulers and Gouernors had no lawfull power nor aucthority to iudg Chriſt, nor his diſciples for matters of faith, they being in all other thinges obedient to their lawes. But men wil ſay all this is anſwered in one word. They were heathen Rulers. Now if our lord the K. will challeng a Prerogative or power, becauſ. he profeſſeth Chriſt, then let it be lawfull for the King ſervants, to tell the King that it he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to be a diſciple of Chriſt, that gives the King no power to do anie of all theſe thinges to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to baniſh, to put to death, that belongs onely to his earthly Kingdome: for Chriſt and Appoſtles had no ſuch power given them: neither taught they the diſciples to take vpon them anie ſuch power, and to execute it vpon the contrary mynded, but taught them the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary <hi>to inſtruct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with meeknes,</hi> and by preaching the word ſeeke their converſion, with all long ſuffering, and not to deſtroy them by ſevere puniſhments: yea the diſciples of Chriſt muſt wait and labor for <hi>the grafting in againe of the Iewes,</hi> according to the propheſies of the ſcriptures. Rom. 11.24.27. and therefore the King knowes they may not be deſtroyed, although they be the greateſt enimies of Chriſt that are vpon the earth, and have, and yet do caſt the greateſt reproach and contempt vpon Chriſt, with ſuch words, as are moſt fearfull to vtter: yet muſt the diſciples of Chriſt wait for their converſion, and not worke their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And let our lord the King call to mynd,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:26859:44"/> how the Appoſtle Paul teacheth all the diſciples of Chriſt to be mynded towards all infidells Rom. 1. 14.15. where he ſaith. <hi>Iam debter both to the Grecian and to the Barbarian both to the wiſe and to the vn wiſe.</hi> And the ſame Appoſtle 1. Cor. 9.20.21.22. ſaith, <hi>To the Iewes I become as a Iew: to them that are vnder the law, as though I were vnder the law: to them that are without the law as though I were without the law: to the weake I become as weake, that I may wi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the weake, I am made</hi> (ſaith Th-appoſtle) <hi>all thinges to all men, that I might by all meanes ſave ſome.</hi> All theſe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and directions, are for our lord the King to direct the King how he ſhould go in and out with holines &amp; all meeknes before his people to wynne them to Chriſt: and not to ſet vp a Cruell Hyrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy to make havock of the K. people, (as. Saul did) pulling them out of their houſes both men and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: caſting them into priſons: forceing them to flee the land, and perſecuting them with all cruelty. May the King ſuffer all this to be done by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, vpon this ground of being a Chriſtian King? the Kings ſervants ſhewe the King yet once agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in all humility, that Chriſt the King did not ſo himſelf: he never appointed to be puniſhed anie one man for deſobeing his Goſpell, with the leaſt bodily puniſhment. And therefore wee inſtantly exhort our lord the King that the King would be no longer ſeduced by thoſe moſt dangerous deceivers, that have gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Kings power to puniſh thoſe, that Chriſt, the King of Iſraell would not puniſh: &amp; that perſuade the King that the King hath the ſame power in the Kingdome and over the houſe and people of Chriſt, that the Kings of Iſraell had in that Kingdome, and over that houſe, and people of God, as it was the Church of God.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:26859:45"/>
               <p>Wee (according to our great weaknes) have ſhewed to our lord, the King before, that the King cannot challeng that power, meaning onely in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Religion. And wee will by the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour repeat the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of the whole ground in few words: and wee beſeech the King that wee may the rather do it, in that the whole cauſe depends thereon. And wee repeat it vnto the King in theſe few words, which ſhall never be diſanulled or made void, whilſt the heavens and earth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: not becauſe they are our words, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, anie ſuch arrogancie ſhould poſſeſſe our harts: but they ſhall never be made void, neither ſhall anie ever be able to gain-ſay them with anie ſhew of truth, becauſe they are the words of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God of truth, whereby wee ſhew vnto the King, that the King cannot have that power (in reſpect of Religion to God) in the kingdome and over the houſe and Iſraell or people of Chriſt now, that the Kings of Iſraell had in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in the tune of the law. The ground wee repeat vnto the King is this. That the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſraell was an earthly or worldly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: an earthly or worldly Temple, Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, or houſe: an earthly or worldly people: and the King an earthly King, who in and over all that kingdome, Temple, and people could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire onely earthly obedience. But the kingdome of Chriſt now, is an heavenly kingdome <hi>not of this world:</hi> his Temple, Tabernacle, or houſe <hi>an heavenly Temple, Tabernacle, or houſe,</hi> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a heavenly, or ſpirituall people, <hi>not of this world:</hi> and the King Chriſt Ieſus <hi>a heavenly ſpirituall King.</hi> requiring ſpirituall obedience.</p>
               <p>Therefore our lord the King can not as a King have anie power over this kingdome, Temple
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:26859:45"/> Tabernacle, houſe and People of God in reſpect of the Religion of God: becauſe our lord the King his kingdome is an earthly kingdome: and to our lord the King belongs onely all earthly obedience ſervice, and duty, which ought to ſuffice anie earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man. And the God of all Grace, give our lord the King a gracious hart fully, to be ſatiſfied and contented with that great honor power and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that belongs vnto the King and to give glory and honor to God for it, that it may go well with the King and his poſterity for ever. And the God of heaven deliver the King from all ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters of Egipt, as ſhall perſwade the King to take vpon him the power of the Kings of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, over the Church of Chriſt, onely for the ſetting vp, and ſupporting of their <hi>High Prieſt hood</hi> with <hi>vrim, and Thummim,</hi> with <hi>Pompe, and power:</hi> and the <hi>Leviticall revenewes of Iſraell,</hi> which they challeng and hold as apperteyning thervnto forceing the Kings people by cruelty to obey them, as though with them onely remayned, the oracles of God.</p>
               <p>And now if they will ſhew anie manner of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes vnto God, or faithfulnes to the King or anie regard to Gods people, let them not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inteyne their kingdome, which they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned of the King by <hi>deceit and flatteries,</hi> as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied Dan. 11.21. Let them not mainteyne it by the Kings ſword and power: but let them come furth with that ſword and power, whereof they glory ſo much, and vſe ſo little, and mainteyne their names power &amp; cruelty with it, and wee profeſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, &amp; the whole hoaſt of heaven: &amp; before our Lord the King and all his people, that if they can prove evidently to our conſciences by the holy word of God, that wee may obey them in all their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:26859:46"/> Canons and decrees, and give them thoſe names and titles, without the everlaſting deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſoules and bodies in hell: yea if they can but prove that wee ought to reſt or depend vpon their iugd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; vnderſtandings in the expoſition of anie one part of Gods word: or that they have power to ordeyne and appoint anie one Ordinance, or the manner of adminiſtring anie one Ordinance in the worſhip of God and Church of Chriſt, wee profeſſ. vnto our lord the King wee will yeild them all the obedience they require. But if they will prove theſe thinges onely by Conuotation Canons, how can our lord the King require that the Kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould diſhonor God, by caſting his holy truth away, and with it the ſalvation of our ſoules, and depend vpon their Canons, and yeild them obedience, and periſh both in ſoules and bodies. Wee have rather choſen thus to ſay downe our lives at the feet of our lord the King in preſenting the cauſe into the Kings preſence. Saying with Eſter. <hi>If, we periſh, we periſh</hi> for coming thus boldly vncalled into the Kings preſence: but we will wait with hope and expectation, that through the gracious worke of the lord, the King will hold furth his golden rod, that wee may live: and not ſo onely but alſo that by the Kings meanes <hi>comfort and delivrance ſhall appeare vnto Iſraell.</hi> And that our lord the King will ſay, as that great King of Perſia ſaid, Ezra. 1.2. <hi>The lord God of heaven hath given me many Kingdomes of the earth, and hath comaunded me to build him an houſe in Ieruſalem, who is he amongſt you of all his people, with whome his God is, let him go to Ieruſalem &amp; build the houſe of the lord God of Iſraell.</hi> And as King Darius ſaid, Ezra. 6.7.16. <hi>Suffer the worke of the houſe of God, that the Iſraelites may build this houſe of God in his place, that they may offer ſweet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:26859:46"/> odours vnto the God of heaven, and pray for the Kings life and for his ſonnes.</hi> And as Artahſhaſhte King of Perſia ſaid Ezra. 7.23. <hi>what ſoever is by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the God of heaven; let it be done ſpedily for the houſe of the God of heaven, for why ſhould he be wroath againſt the Realme of the King, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus beſeeching the director of all harts to direct the Kings hart in theſe thinges, wee continew praying for the King and his Sonne, and the Kings Realmes and children. That the King and his ſeed, to Gods glory, may ſitt vpon the thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Great Brittane whilſt the earth endures, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing from God, wiſedome and Riches, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor befitting the dignity of their high Renowne: &amp; that they may walke in the waies of god that god according to his promiſſe may prolong their dayes. And the Lord give all the Kings people faithfull, vpright, and honeſt harts, that they may all with one hart as one man. <hi>Feare God: and Honor and obey the King,</hi> with all the honor and obedience that hath, or can be due to anie earthly King or Prince, which is, all earthly and worldly obedience with lands goods, bodie, and life.</p>
               <p>And wee moſt humbly ſupplicate our Lord the King and all the honorable and worthy Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors vnder the King that they will not ſuffer them ſelves to be miſſed in judgment in condemning vs as movers of Sedition, and our bookes for ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions bookes, becauſe wee differ from the recieved profeſſion of Religion in the land, but that they will according to that great gravity and wiſedome that is vpon them, wey what Sedition is, and they will eaſly find that to profeſſe and teach a differing judgment in Religion to the State, cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

The danger that Chriſt foretold of, is: that in thoſe days (which are theſe daies) <hi>manie ſhall come</hi> (who now are come) <hi>in Chriſts name,</hi> and ſay: <hi>Loe heere is Chriſt, Loe there is Chriſt: and manie falſe Chriſt ſhall ariſe, and manie falſe Prophetts, and ſhall ſhewe great ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and wonders ſo as if were poſſible, they ſhould decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the very elect.</hi> Way then with your ſelves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you had not need to conſider, when the daies are ſo dangerous &amp; perillous, as <hi>if it were poſſible the very elect ſhould be deceived:</hi> ſuch is the danger of theſe daies, by reaſon of the falſe profeſſions of Chriſt, and falſe Prophetts that do ariſe. And ſeeing the falſe Prophetts are the Teachers and maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the falſe profeſſions, wee ſhall endeauor to diſcover them both vnder one, and will onely ſpeake of ſuch falſe Prophetts, and profeſſions as are amongſt you, and knowne to you, not burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you with the multitude of ſtraing and forreyn falſe Prophetts and falſe profeſſions that are in the world; whereof wee generally admoniſh you to beware of; but it is full time that you tooke to thoſe falſe profeſſions and falſe Prophetts that are

               <p>The firſt where of is, that great, and ſo much applauded profeſſion of Puritaniſme. The which profeſſion to prove it is a falſe profeſſion, yea and ſuch a falſe profeſſion, as wee know not the like vpon the earth, wee ſhall not need to produce anie teſtimony but your owne: for whereas in your ſo manie bookes, you cry out of the thinges that are amiſſe among you, and ſue, and ſupplicate, and yet ſtill continew in your former waies, you teſtifie hereby againſt your ſelves, that you are vnrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and that there is a way of reformation, wherein you would be, if you might have leave or licenſe to enter thereinto: which ſeeing you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obteyne, you iuſtify it lawfull to walke in an vnreformed profeſſion of Religion, vpon this ground becauſe you may not have leave by act of Parliament to reforme. What falſer profeſſion can be found vpon the earth then this of yours, who profeſſe that you knowe a way of much truth where in you would walke, but you do not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot by the ſuperior power be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>Let this ſuffice in this place to prove that you walke in a falſe profeſſion of Chriſt, by your owne acknowledgment, calling dayly for liberty that you might reforme your ſelves, but ſeing it will not

Your grounds and reaſons wee ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after (by Gods aſſiſtance) try: but in the meane time let Gods people knowe, that there will never warrant be found, to give men liberty for anie time, to deferr to <hi>eſchew evill,</hi> and to refrayne <hi>to do good,</hi> for feare of men, or in obedience vnto men, or vnder anie pretence what ſoever. Moſt wicked and falſe is that profeſſion; and moſt falſe Prophetts are all thoſe that profeſſe and teath ſuch a doctrine that men are not bound without anie delay, al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects laid aſide, with all ſpeed to <hi>eſchew evil and do good,</hi> as that true Prophett, David did, and taught who ſaith, Pſal. 119.60. <hi>I made haiſt and delayed not, to keepe thy comaundements.</hi> And ſo wee proceed to ſhew that all your Puritane Prophetts (ſo called) are falſe Prophetts, and ſuch as our Saviour Chriſt fortells of, who ſay, <hi>Loe Here is Chriſt,</hi> but comaunds, <hi>beleeve them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although wee might prove you all falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetts becauſe you teach manie falſe doctrines, yet wee hold it the moſt eaſy and plaine way, for the vnderſtanding of all to ſhew you to be falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetts, becauſe you are not ſent, nor called of God, &amp; herein ſhall you have the leaſt deceaveable ſhewe for your ſelves.</p>
               <p>But before wee ſpeake of your not being called &amp; ſent of God (which muſt appeare by your Election and ordination vnto the Office or worke of a Biſhop or Paſtor, for other Prophetts wee knowe none amongſt you) wee will ſet downe the gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherewith they are to be qualified, that are to be elected and ordeyned, and vndertake that Office: as alſo how their wives &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are to be qualified

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are his words, and this is his law. <hi>Let a Biſhop or Paſtor be the huſband of one wife, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, temperate, modeſt, harborous, apt to teach, and able to exhort with wholſome doctrine, and to convince them that ſay againſt it, nor given to wyne; no ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, no fighter not covetous, one that can rule his owne houſe honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, haveing children vnder obedience withall reverence. Let him not be a yong Diſciple, or newly planted in. Let him be well reported of, even of them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Let his wife be honeſt, no evill ſpeaker, ſober, faithfull in all thinges.</hi> This is the law of God 1. Tim. 3. Tit. 1. according to this law, in every perticuler, muſt a Biſhop or Paſtor, and his wife, and children be qualified for it is the law of the perfect law-giver. And thou ſhall have no other Biſhop or Paſtor before his face. This wee ſet downe to put you and the people of God in mynd to looke firſt, that you their Biſhops or Paſtors be thus qualified, for all that are not ſo both in them ſelves, and their wives and children are not ſent of God to be Paſtors of his flock, but are falſe Prophetts in the firſt degree, for God ſendeth none but thoſe that are according to his owne rule: and hereby may you ſee that every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man and excellent preacher may not be a Biſhop and Paſtor over the houſe of God.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:26859:50"/>
               <p>And now Election and Ordination, which is the doore and way, whereby the true Biſhops and Paſtors of the flock do enter. The holy ghoſt doth teach. Act. 14.23. that election and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were performed in and by the Church or Congregation with faſting and praier: this is the doore &amp; way, and all that have entred by anie other way, <hi>are theves and robbers,</hi> as our Saviour Chriſt teſtifieth Ioh. 10. Are you not all now at once convinced? and muſt you not all be forced to confeſſe that you have no ſuch Election nor Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination? is your purchaſed Election of Patrons either perticuler men, or of deane and Echapter, or ſome Colledg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the private Election of ſome frend like vnto this holy order of Election, which Chriſt hath appointed in his Church, to be made with the gracious free &amp; full conſent of every hart &amp; tongue in the whole congregation? how woefull and wretched is the eſtate of you all (if you repent not) that joyne in this great wickednes to deprive the Church of Chriſt of ſuch a bleſſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ordinance of Chriſt, how bleſſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable a thinge were it, for a holy people ſo to Elect their Paſtors that ſhould lead them, and feed them with the wholeſome word of doctrine and Exhortation, and watch over their ſoules in the lord.</p>
               <p>And what a bleſſed comfort were it for a holy man to be ſo elected of a holy people: ſo ſhould a Godly people have holy Paſtors over them, whom they would all love and reverence: and ſo ſhould Godly Paſtors have a holy people to followe them whome they would carefully feed and cheriſh, and this is the Ordinance of God, and law of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:26859:51"/> Election: but to get an Election for monie either of a mans owne, or of his frends, or by private favour or frendſhip or beholdinges to men, and ſo corruptly to become a Paſtor over a flock of people diverſly affected, and manie openly prophane and wicked, here is an vnholy Election of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Paſtor, over a corrupt and vnholy flock, this is not to enter in by the dore but to clyme vp ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, which ſeeing you all do, not anie one of you entring by that holy Election which Chriſt hath appointed, Chriſt him ſelfe hath adiudged you all, not to be the ſhepherds of the ſheepe, but to be <hi>theeves and robbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus are you all falſe Prophetts: how ſhall you be able to ſtand before the lord in this matter? or how can you iuſtifie your ſelves before men? will you make the word of the lord of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and bleſſe your ſelves in your owne waies, if you ſhall ſtill do ſo, as you have long done, yet ſhall you not be bleſſed of the lord, in that you do herein violate and vtterly aboliſh that holy law of Election, which Chriſt hath ordeyned in his Church for the chuſing of the true ſhepherds of his ſheepe, and for the keeping of theeves and robbers out of his ſhepefold.</p>
               <p>Next in order to be ſpoken of is <hi>Ordination,</hi> a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinance of God, comanded by the holy ghoſt Tit. 1.5. and the example of the adminiſtration thereof, given vs by th-Appoſtles in the church of Chriſt Act. 6.6. &amp; practiced by the diſciples Act. 13.1.3 And taught vs to be a doctrine of the beginings of Chriſt, and of the foundation Heb. 6.1.2. being called

Is the holy Ordinance of laying on of hands one of the doctrines of the foundation Heb. 6.1.2. and may it be come by, by anie meanes, or from anie perſons yea even from the Pope? and you approve of it as you do, ſeeing you have no Miniſtery but from Rome, it is the roote from whence all your Miniſtery is ſprung, and the Wild Olive wherein you are all by your Ordination engrafted: and therefore as the roote is, ſuch are the branches: and the roote you all confeſſe is moſt vnholy, and ſo doth the lord judg you, you evill ſervants out of your owne monethes, you are all moſt vnholy, and falſe Prophetts, the Prophetts of the Beaſt, and not of Chriſt in that you are not <hi>Elected,</hi> and <hi>Ordeyned</hi> by the rules of Chriſt and have not the word of God nor teſtimony of your flocks for your true entrance.</p>

Beſides this wee muſt tel you (beare it patiently) that it is but ignorant diſſimulation in you to ſay, you vndergo all theſe thinges becauſe you would not breake the peace off the Church, for if you did ſo much tender the peace off the Church as you pretend, and that you would not have your beloved ſtirred vp, nor wakened before ſhe pleaſe, why then have you written ſo manie bookes off open contempt? Why have you ſought ſo much, and made challenge for diſputations, why doe you make ſo manie loude outcries and dayly complaints and tedious <hi>Parliament</hi> ſuites? How can you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly device more vnpeaceable courſes, except you ſhould raiſe tumults contrary to the law of God and of the King (which we know is not in your thoughts) you can no way device to bee more vnpeaceable:

Oh that you could ſee that it is your owne peace that you reſpect in al this. For what breatch off peace had it bene in the Church, iff you al had pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably withdrawne yourſelves, and loveingly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Church holding it a true Church as you do, had it not bene much more peace, and much leſſe troble for the Church iff you had ſo done? There is no queſtion it had: but whether your peace and profit would have followed, is the queſtion, and take heed that bee not the cauſe of your (<hi>for peace</hi> as you call it) vndergoing off theſe things. Wee could ſpeake largly of this point, but wee ſpare you, onely wiſhing you not to perſwade your ſelves, nor to make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thinke that you have ſuffered great things, whilſt you eate the fat of the Land, but knowe this, all you that eate anie bread from whoſe hands ſoever, by, or in reſpect of your Office of miniſtery, that you feed off the portion of his meat, whome you ſeeke to deſtroy, fulfilling the propheſie of Dan. 11.26.

And now wee adviſe you to bee aſhamed, to plead that you doe vndergo theſe thinges for the peace off the Church, except you wil hold your peace: For you are wiſe enough to knowe that there is no other way to breake the inward peace of the Church, which peace you muſt needs meane, for it is not in your powers nor hartes, to breake the outward peace of the Church, and there is no other way to breake the inward peace of the Church, but by words and writings of oppoſition and contention, and makeing deviſion, al which you have practiſed to the vttermoſt of your powers, and when for feare of your owne peace you durſt go no further, then have you ſett out your bookes of vnknowne Authors (which therein are no better then Libels) wherein you have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what troubles and diſſentions you make in the Church ſo you can preſerve your owne peace. And thus do you mainteine by al force and viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention a moſt trobleſome civil war, which of all is moſt dangerous in Church and Comon wealth, and yet you profeſſe you ſuffer and vndergo al theſe evils

Can you devide Chriſts goverment (as hee is a King) from his power, or his power from this goverment? Will you make him a king without goverment? Wherein then is he a King otherwiſe then in name? If the Lord-Biſhops ſhould compel you to denie Chriſt off the name of a king, in, or over his Church, would you not then ſay, they overthrew a fundamentall point off faith? And have you not vnderſtanding to deferne, that the power or Goverment of a King is off farr greater authoritie then the name of a king, and were it not a much leſſe matter for a king to bee deprived of the name and title of a king, then of the power and goverment of a king.

Bee wiſe in ſpiritual wiſedome, and then you wil yeild, that true goverment is of as abſolute neceſſitie in the Church of Chriſt vnder the Goſpell as it was in the Temple vnder the Law. And if you will bee of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding according to all the vnderſtanding off men, you wil confeſſe that a kings owne goverment, by his owne lawes and Ordinances is fundamental and of abſolute neceſſitie in his owne kingdome, and over his owne ſubiects, or els he is a king but onely in name, and not in power: then muſt you needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that Chriſts Goverment is of abſolute neceſſitie
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:26859:63"/> and fundamental in his Kingdome, or els you make him but a king in name: and how can you in all true iudgment, but acknowledg that it is much better, to have the power and goverment of a King, without the name of King, then to have the name of a King, and not the power and goverment of a King. And therefore you might as well ſubmitt to the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to take away Chriſts name of a King, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to take away from him the power and goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a King: but therein lyes the depth of the miſterie of iniquitie in the man of ſinne, in takeing wholly from him his power, and yet profeſſing his name: and here by are al the Nations of the Earth deceived, and this it is that blinds you al, becauſe you have the profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off Chriſts name amongſt you, ſaying <hi>he is your king,</hi> this makes you reſt ſatiſfied, although you yeild vnto him no one thinge els that apperteynes to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Office, but onelie the name and title off a King. That wee may make this plaine vnto you (for you ſee it not) that you give Chriſt onelie the name off a King in your Church, wee ſhewe it vnto you thus: all that can bee given to a King off his ſubiects, is to give vnto him all the titles off honor due vnto his name, and to ſubmitt in obedience vnto his power: This is al that God requireth to himſelf in the 1.2.3. and 4.

Gen. 17. You ſhal ſee with what evidence the Lord in mercie doth ſet it downe. Thus ſaith the Lord to Abraham <hi>I wil eſtablish my Covenant betweene thee and me, &amp; thy ſeed after thee in their generation for an everlaſting Covenant to bee God vnto thee and thy ſeed after the, and I wil give to thee and to thy ſeed after thee, all the Land of Canaan for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, and I wilbee their God:</hi> this is on the Lords behalf: and ſaith the Lord, <hi>This is the Covenant that thou and thy ſeed after thee ſhal kepe. Let every man-child amonge you bee circumciſed, yee shal circumciſe the foreskinne of your Flesh, and every man-Child at eight days old, aſwel he that is borne in the houſe as he that is bought with monie.</hi> this is the Covenant on Abrahams be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his ſeed. Thus doth the lord declare in every perticuler, his Covenant with his people, aſwel what he wil do for them, as alſo what he requireth them to do in obedience to him: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d here wee ſee God hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded Abra, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his ſeed to circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſe al the males in their houſe. And now this Covenant is diſanulled, and all the Ordinances thereof, as is ſhewed. Heb. 7.18. And the Lord ſaith he wil make a <hi>new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, not like the old,</hi> teaching vs that wee ſhould not forme and frame it according to the old, but that wee ſhould receive it, according to the new forme and frame wherein he delivers it: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

How dare you then thus contend againſt the Lord: and whereas he ſaith he wil make a new Covenant not according to the old, you wil ſay, and have it according to the old, for you wil have it that according as infants were circumciſed vnder the old Covenant, ſo you will haue infants Baptized vnder the new, is not this to ſet yourſelves againſt the lord and to change his Covenant: which he hath ſealed with his blood, and after your owne wils in what you thinke good, to make it according to the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, directly contrary to the Lords owne word a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſaying, and you have no way to mainteyne the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of infants, but by ſaying the new Covenant is according to the old, and this is to ſay directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſaying of the Lord, who is the Covenant maker, and who ſaith, in plaine words, the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which I wil make with Iſraell ſhal not bee according to the old. Here it is made evident to al that wil not reſiſt the truth, that your baptizing of infants is contrary to the new Covenant of the Lord. Thus do you to make your owne tradition good, make the new Covenant like the old, which the Lord ſaith is not like the old: how can you poſſibly oppoſe the word of the lord more directly? Furthermore the holy ghoſt by the Author vnto the Heb. Chap. 9. endeavoring by al evidence to prove that the new Covenant is not like the old ſheweth that the old Teſtament or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant had <hi>a worldly Sanctuary,</hi> and that the ſervice of that Tabernacle onely <hi>ſtood in meates and drincks and divers washings, and Carnall rites, which purified the Flesh, but purged not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:</hi>

Wee diſire moreover the people off God whoſe harts are ſect to ſeeke his face that they wil ſearch the Scriptures to ſee what the baptiſme of the new Teſtament is declared to bee, which being faithfullie ſearched into ſhall convince vnto all the Earth, that it cannot apperteyne vnto infants.</p>
               <p>And firſt in the goſpel according to Mark. 1.4. It is preached by Iohn to bee <hi>Baptiſme of amendement of life, for the remiſsion of ſinnes:</hi> And Thapoſtle Rom. 6.4. ſaith. <hi>Baptiſme is a burieing into the death of Chriſt, that wee should walke in newnes of life: and</hi> Gal. 3.26, 27.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:26859:90"/> off life, for the remiſſion of ſinnes in Infants? and can Infants bee buried into the death of Chriſt to walke in newnes of life? and can infants put on Chriſt by faith? if they can do none of al theſe thinges, which is moſt plaine they cannot, then may they not bee Baptized. What were ſufficient to give ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this long conceived error of baptizing infants You may ſee, by the ordinance it ſelfe they are not capeable of it: and you may ſee that the lord by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant doth not commaund nor require anie ſuch thinge at the hands of parents to Baptize their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and all their houſhould. The Covenant is that men ſhould beleeve and bee Baptized, but their is no one word to comaund them to baptiſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and all their houſ hould. Oh that you would bee wearie of this your great ignorance, to ſay that baptiſme is the ſeale of the Covenant, and yet you wil ſeale them, that cannot receive the ſeale, and them that are not once mentioned in the Covenant, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in vnder the Covenant whome you wil, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the wil and mynd of the Lord: and although the Covenant ſhall ſtill overthrowe you, that there can none bee vnder the Covenant, but they which beleeve and are Baptized, for the Lord wil admit of no other then he hath mentioned in his Covenant, though you ſeale never ſo manie with water and words: although this might ſuffice yet wee will endeavor by the Lords aſſiſtance to convince you by your owne ground.</p>
               <p>You cannot denie, but that there is neither rule nor example in al the new Teſtament for the Baptizing off infants, whereby you confeſſe that the Mediator off the new Teſtament hath not appointed it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are drive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to prove it by conſequence makeing your ſelves and the ſimple beleeve, that it muſt needs follow by a neceſſarie conſequence: that as infants
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:26859:91"/> were circumciſed, ſo muſt they bee baptized. Iff you will have a neceſſary conſequence of this, then muſt you make it off the whole matter and not of part, as you thinke good, as thus: Hee that wil bee a Proſelite muſt bee circumciſed, and all the males in his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould: ſo then if your conſequence from this ground be neceſſary, he that wilbe a Diſciple of Chriſt muſt be baptized and al his houſhold, it followeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your conſequence that no man can be admitted a Diſciple except al his houſhold wilbee baptized: for no man could be admitted a Proſelite except all his males were circumciſed. If then a Iew that hath a wyfe and divers Children and bondmen (as they have) come to the faith of Ieſus, iff his Wyfe or anie of his Children or bondmen will not bee Baptized, then cannot he bee admitted to bee a diſciple of Chriſt, except you will allowe him by his authoritie to cauſe them to bee Baptized whether they beleeve or no, as they did by their authoritie circumciſe their houſ hold. Thus muſt your conſequence ſtand iff you will not bee willing to deceive your ſelves in the meanes off your ſalvation. Deale Faithfully therefore with God and his truth, and his people, you that take vpon you to bee guids, and lead not Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to deſtruction by ſuch deceits as this, that when you have neither rule, nor example, to prove that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants muſt be baptized, yea and when the Covenant of the Lord doth evidently debarr them: and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance off Baptiſme conſidered in it ſelfe alſo, yet you will to bring in and mainteyne, he tradition off your Elders prove it by a conſequence from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the old Teſtament, and make the new, like the old: When the Lord ſaith it is not like, nor ſhallbee according to the old. And if the people off God would but with vpright harts read diligently, the whole Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:26859:91"/> ſhould (through the grace off God) find to their ful ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction the difference betwixt the old Covenant and the new: and the Preiſthood, and the Tabernacle, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Ordinances, Services, and Sacrifices ſet downe ſo plainly as it would make an end of this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and manie moe, to the advancement of Gods truth, and the ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſoules of his people, that ſhall follow him in the regeneration or new birth, which is to bee borne againe of water and of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: In which regeneration or new birth who ſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth him not, cannot enter into the kingdome off Heaven.

Can you walke thus and thinke to pleaſe God? Will God bee pleaſed with you when you walke in thoſe waies that beſt pleaſe your owne mynds? Bee not deceived, God will not hold you gilties for thus vſing his name and Ordinance in vaine. If you will examine the new Teſtament throughout, you ſhall find no ſeale, nor none ſealed, but they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, <hi>who are ſealed with the Holy Spirit of promiſſe.</hi> Epheſ. 1.13. By which <hi>Holy Spirit wee are all Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into one body.</hi> 1. Cor. 12.13. And there is but <hi>one Spirit, one Baptiſme, and one body.</hi> Epheſ. 4.4.5. Which holy ſeale of the Spirit ſeeing infants cannot have, they cannot bee Baptized with that one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, into that one body: ſo is your conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the baptizing of infants directly contrary to the Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ordinance of God: the Covenant of the lord being that they <hi>which beleeve &amp; are baptized shalbe ſaved,</hi> and the ordinance being <hi>the baptiſme of repentance for the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this point with a ground that al who have anie knowledg of the word of God will confeſſe which is this: the Covenant of the new Teſtament is a Covenant of life and ſalvation onely to all that beleeve and are baptized. Mark. 16.16. The ſeale off the Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt needs be aunſwereable to that holy
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:26859:94"/> Covenant: a ſeale of life and ſalvation onelie to them that beleeve and are Baptized Epheſ. 1.13.14. Revel. 2.17. and 28. Thappoſtle here to the Epheſ. doth ſhewe that <hi>after they beleeved they were ſealed with the holie Spirit of promiſſe.</hi> Let all then confeſſe with whome there is anie vprightnes that infants who cannot beleeve, <hi>(for Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Rom. 10.17.)</hi> cannot bee ſealed with the ſeale of this Covenant: it is not in the power of parents to ſet this ſeale vpon their infants, as it was in their power to ſet the ſigne of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vpon their Fleſh: Therefore is it not required of them by the Lord: and it is altogether impietie and wickednes, and a prophaning of the holie ordinance of God to take in hand to adminiſter it vpon infants and the Lord will revenge himſelfe for ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes if it bee not repented of. But againſt this ground of truth that the Covenant of life and ſalvation is made onelie with them that beleeve and are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, it is obiected, that the Covenant is made with them and their ſeed, and though manie writers write thus, and moſt men affirme it, yet <hi>Mr. Robinſon,</hi> being next hand, wee will produce his warrant for this ground being as good as anie others, and he as vnadviſedlie overſeene in the ſetting it downe: Thus ſpeakes he in his Booke Pag. 282. <hi>The Scriptures everie where teach that parents by their faith bring their Children into the Covenant off the Church, &amp; intitle them to the promiſſes,</hi> litle doth <hi>Mr. Rob</hi> thinke how ſuddenlie in his accuſtomed haiſt he hath brought in a meritorious faith, it were to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:26859:94"/> faith, for their Children, nor to condemne them for their parents infidelity, this is but one among manie of <hi>Mr. Ro.</hi> doctrines of Devils which he hath heaped vp in his tedious booke: his proofe for his doctrine is. Gen. 17. And wee prove his doctrine moſt falſe by Gen. 17. where Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his faith, and earneſt praier to God could not bring Iſmael his Child, of 13. yere old vnder that Covenant, verſ. 18-21.</p>
               <p>Thus is <hi>Mr. Ro.</hi> altogether overſeene in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that he himſelf allegeth: Add moreover to this Gen. 25.23. Where <hi>Izhaks</hi> faith, could not bring <hi>Eſau</hi> vnder the Covenant. Thus may all ſee that <hi>Mr. Ro.</hi> doth but quote ſcripture for his proofe, and not ſhewe how it proves his ground. The next proofe for this ground is Act. 2.39. Where Thappo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking, to, and of al the vnbeleeving <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentils</hi> ſaith, <hi>the promiſſe is made to you and to your Children, even as manie as the Lord our God shall call.</hi> How <hi>Mr. Ro.</hi> will apply this to his purpoſe we knowe not, but wee confeſſe that this promiſſe, <hi>(They that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and are Baptized shalbee ſaved)</hi> is made to al the vnbeleeving <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentils,</hi> and their Children, to this day: but this doth no way prove that the faith of the parents in titles children to the promiſſes, nor that the promiſſe of ſalvation is made to the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Iewes and Gentils, or to their Children, except they and their children <hi>amend their lives and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi> And whereas <hi>Mr. Rob.</hi> as it ſhould ſeeme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, children in this place, to bee infants, wee wil firſt leave that to him to prove, that thappoſtle ſpeakes heare concerning infants, and then wee will require of him how he proves, that the inheritance off the Kingdome of heaven goes by ſucceſſion of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as the land of <hi>Canaan did.</hi>

To prove him a falfe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in this alſo wee refer the Godly reader to the 1.

               <p>Thus leaving to your remembrance that Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s faith could not bring his Children vnder the Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in that it did not bring <hi>Iſmael,</hi> nor anie one of his ſix ſonnes that he had by <hi>Keturah</hi> his Wife, vnder the Covenant, Gen. 25. and therefore that is a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful and falſe ground to ſay, that they were circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciſed, becauſe they were vnder the Covenant, and that they are vnder the Covenant by Abrahams faith, for then had al Abrahams bondmen and houſhold bene vnder the Covenant, and Iſmael whome the Lord denyes to bee vnder the Covenant, and yet he, and they al were commaunded to bee circumciſed.</p>

               <p>This then is the ground of truth, which cannot be gainſaied, that al the males free, and bond, that were borne in Abrahams houſe, or bought with his monie, which were not of his ſeed, were al to bee circumciſed becauſe it was the Covenant that God comaunded Abraham to kepe, to circumciſe al his males: and not becauſe they were al vnder the Covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion by Abrahams faith, this is but a vaine inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the man of ſinne, and a miſtery of iniquity to deceive them that have pleaſure in vnrighteouſnes, haveing no ſhewe, nor warrant of ſcripture, to ſay they were circumciſed, becauſe they were vnder the Covenant by Abrahams faith: al evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is againſt it, in that the lord doth plainly declare in his word, that they were to be circumciſed that were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus then is this ground off truth moſt evident a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d plaine: they that through grace in Chriſt receive the love off the truth, they are the Elect of God, and ſhal not bee deceived, but ſhal bee ſaved: But they that through the effectuall working of Sathan, withal his ſignes and lying wonders, receive not the love of truth, they ſhalbee deceived, and beleeve lyes, and bee damned. Moreover our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>if the ignorant lead the ignorant, they shal both fall into the pit.</hi> Mat. 15.14. let al therefore take heed, and learne to knowe the truth of God, and to love it, and to vnderſtand his word themſelves, ſeeing the Lord hath comaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, not to followe ſuch as ſay: <hi>Loe here is Chriſt loe there is Chriſt,</hi> but to looke vnto the ſhyning light of truth, whereof, if they bee not able to iudg and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerne of themſelves (by the direction of Gods ſpirit) they can never have faith nor aſſurance in the way they walke, ſo ſhal they runne blindfold to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not knoweing whether they are ſedd: Falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,

And if they that through ignorance are led into falſe ways ſhalbee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then they that through ignorance lead men into falſe ways ſhal alſo be ſaved, and ſo ſhall (allmoſt) all fleſh bee ſaved, for who can not plead ignorance for al their tranſgreſſions, in al falſe worſhip, and all their falſe waies? But they that are ignorant, let them bee ignorant: and let all the diſciples of Chriſt <hi>covet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual gifts, that they may propheſie, and pray with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and ſinge with vnderſtanding, and ſpeake with vnderſtanding, that they may inſtruct others, and in vnderſtanding be of a ripe age.</hi> 1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſalvation is required off all the Diſciples off Chriſt alike, there being but one law of obedience for all: and Chriſt hath not appointed anie one to bee more ignorant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to every one that aſke alike, he gives alike a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they that ſeeke a like, ſhal find a like.

But this ground is moſt wickedly perverted and brought in to excuſe al vnwilling mynds to be enformed, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly reſiſt the truth, and have no willing mynds to be directed by Gods word, no furthee then ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds with their good likeing, and yet this ground muſt excuſe al their falſe worſhip, and al falſe waies, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d al falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and expoſition of the ſcriptures, and al the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation off the holy ordinances of God, which they do through ignorance, although they repent not there off, but iuſtifie themſelves to do wel therein.

Why then if the adulterer, drunckard, blaſphemer, ydolater, and Covetous man, bee fully
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:26859:102"/> perſwaded in their mynds, that they ſinne not in doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe thinges, they ſhal alſo be pardoned. Thus muſt the Lord accept of ignorant ſtrong perſwaſions of mens mynds in error and diſobedience, for true knowledg, faith, and obedience: For iff they that through ignorance being fully perſwaded in their mynds or conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces obey vnrighteouſnes and iuſtifie error ſhalbee ſaved, and through Chriſt bee accepted with God, as they that of true knowledg and faith obey righteouſnes, and iuſtify the truth: ſo then is there ſalvacion by Chriſt, through ignorant perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion off mynd and diſobedience aſwel as through true knowledg, faith, and obedience. What wil men make of God? how hath the miſtery of iniquity prevailed? Firſt to take from him his power and goverment in his kingdome, as we have ſhewed, and then to take from him his iuſtice and iudgment: for iff the Lord ſhal not in his iuſtice, iudg thoſe that ignorantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his lawes, ſtatutes, and ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, who <hi>cal light darknes, and darknes light. ſower ſweet, &amp; ſweet ſower.</hi> Eſa. 5.20. Speaking evil off that they knowe not: teaching for doctrines mens precepts, overthrowing the doctrines off the Foundation off the begining off Chriſt, following the ymaginations of their owne harts, and ſetting vp the traditions off men in ſtead of the holie ordinances of God, and becauſe in al theſe thinges, they are ignorant, and walke as far as they ſee, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d do as they are perſwaded in their mynds, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they do God good ſervice, therefore they ſhalbee accepted with God: if the Lord ſhal not in his iuſtice iudg theſe that thus ſinne and tranſgreſſe againſt him, then is the righteous iudgment off the Lord overthrowne, and the Ordinances of Chriſt vnder the Goſpel made of none effect: and if men knowe them, and do them, they ſhal doe wel: But if they bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and walke in falſe waies, mainteyning divers

Epheſ. 2.8. This ground is miſapplied as wee truſt wil eaſily appeare, being brought to prove that if men walke conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as farr as they knowe and commit ſome ſinnes through ignorance and through ignorance iuſtifie the ſame, thinking they do wel, and knowing no better, their ſinne ſhalbee pardoned, which if they be, it muſt bee by grace through perſwaſion and ignorance, for their is no faith in ignorance, where is there anie warrant for ſuch a ground?

We conclude this point by the word of truth that none can deny that have anie knowledg of the meanes of ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: there is no ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but <hi>by grace in Chr, through faith &amp; repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> ſo is there the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Ezek. 18.21.27.</p>
               <p>Wil not the <hi>Pope</hi> make the ſame anſwere for al the bloody perſecutions wherewith he hath, and doth per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecute al Proteſtants: ſo called, Wil not the lord Biſhop make this anſwere for all their wicked and cruel perſecutions againſt the <hi>Puritanes</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Browniſts?</hi> (ſo caled): but ſhal they be pardoned? they iuſtifying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves in al theſe wickedneſſes (wherein they think

               <p>If this were duely conſidered it would make men take heed what they profeſſe or practice in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, ſeeing if they profeſſe or practice anie thinge that is not according to the word of God, and iuſtifie it for good, they muſt periſh and cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: it ſtands therefore al men vpon the peril of their ſoules to looke to their waies, and to bee vpon a ſure ground from Gods word, what they condemne for evil or error: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what they mainteyne and iuſtifie for truth: for if <hi>they that iuſtifie the wicked, &amp; they that condemne the iuſt, be an abhomination vnto the Lord.

If al the learned Scribes and Phariſies and falſe Prophets, in the world had harts to beleeve this, and confeſſe it, it would make them take heed what they iuſtified for truth, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what they conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for error, and how they taught others to do ſo. If al the careles profeſſors of Chriſt that pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſe him in word, would beleeve this word of the lord to bee true, it would make them looke more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly to their waies, and not thinke that anie profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt is ſufficient, and that they may profeſſe Chriſt after that manner that is beſt pleaſing to their owne mynds, makeing the way large that they may

               <p>How doth the ignorant blind, corrupt harts and tongues of theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conceive and ſpeake againſt God and his truth, and pervert it to their owne deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Iudg then what Chriſt wil ſay to theſe falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that are the diſciples of the man of ſinne, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and preſerving his Kingdome by this their doctrine, for the diſciples of Chriſt cannot glorify God and advance his truth better, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſuffering al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſecution for it, and by witneſſing it, againſt the man of ſinne, with the blood of their teſtimony. we muſt leave this point to Godly conſideration (It had bene much fitter (we confeſſe) to have bene part off a booke, then ſuch an addition) and wee leave theſe men withal their diſciples (if they wil not be enformed here in) to be a reproach to al men, who ſhal ſay vnto them where have you learned to fle into forraine countries and not to ſuffer perſecution for Chriſt of your owne countriemen? where have you learned for feare of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to flee from your owne countrie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fathers houſes to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:26859:111"/> whome you ought, and where you might beſt publiſh the goſpel? and where have you learned to drawe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from children, and children from parents, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e they are eſpecially bound to witnes Gods truth? and to be as lights vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>Furthermore if Chriſt gave this for a rule or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to his diſciples to flee perſecution to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then was it an abſolute comaundement, and ſo did al thapoſtles and diſciples of Chriſt, breake his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſinne, in that they did not flee to ſave themſelves alwaies when they were perſecuted: and hereby do theſe men condemne all their brethren that flee not as they do, except they wil ad error to error, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d affirme as ſome of them do, that it is indifferent to flee or not to flee, makeing hereby this precept of Chriſt, indifferent to be obeyed or not to be obeyed, which can not be affirmed of anie one precept of Chriſt: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bee both comaunded and indifferent to bee obeyed or done: and thoſe words of Chriſt wil no way permit ſuch indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ci, for they are an abſolute precept for that end for the which they are given: which is not to flee to ſave themſelves: but to flee or go to another Citie to preach the goſpel. And we put theſe ſeducers in remembrance that our Saviour Chriſt gives this rule alſo vnto his diſciples, that <hi>if they shall enter

It ſhould ſeeme this rule of Chriſt, apperteynes not to theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but let them, and al menſe, that this rule apperteynes to whomeſoever the other apperteynes, they being both given at one time and vpon one and the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and to one and the ſame perſons: and when theſe great deceivers have learned not to devide Chriſt they wil learne alſo, not to devide his precepts and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, takeing what is agreable to their corrupt mynds, and forſakeing what is contrary to them.</p>
